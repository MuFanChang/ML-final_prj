0,Front Page,"An exchange of gunfire and a three-hour standoff with police ended safely yesterday as a suspected organized crime member surrendered to police in New Taipei City???s Jhonghe District (??????).No casualties were reported, the New Taipei City Police Department said.The gunman, identified as Liu Pang-cheng (?????????), is the suspected leader of a drug ring and a chapter head of the Celestial Way (?????????) gang, the department said.Sindian (??¢X???) Precinct polivr had Liu under surveillance for some time because he was suspected of heading a narcotics ring and using drugs to recruit addicts to be dealers, it said.Officers tried to apprehend him yesterday morning after an arrest warrant was issued, the department said.Liu resisted arrest and fled toward Jhonghe with the police in pursuit, leading to a firefight on the streets in which 30 shots were exchanged, police said.Liu then entered a residence on Lane 410, Jingsin Street (??¡Â??¢X???), it said.The police officers who had been pursing Liu retreated some distance from the building and a SWAT team was called in to cordon off the alley and warn local residents before negotiations began, the department said.Liu supposedly had a grenade in addition to guns and threatened to commit suicide during the negotiations.He also demanded to see his girlfriend, who police escorted to the scene to talk with Liu after putting body armor on her.After three hours of negotiations, Liu laid down his weapons and surrendered, police said.Liu is also a suspect in several violent crimes reportedly connected to urban development projects in Taipei???s Zhongshan District (????¡Ó¡Ó) and the attempted blackmail of a man surnamed Shao (???) for NT$3 million (US$99,279), police said.During the standoff, the police department???s priority was protecting bystanders and local residents, and triple security lines were established to keep residents from being taken hostage, Criminal Investigation Corps Commander Liao Hsun-cheng (?????????) said.New Taipei City Police Department Commissioner Hu Mu-yuan (?????????) said Liu had apparently acted out of fear of facing 18 years or more in prison for resisting arrest, drugs and other charges.Officers talking with Liu kept telling him that he would not be sentenced to life in prison or to death and that he would be likely to receive parole if he behaves well in prison, Hu said.A prosecutor who was also at the scene told Liu that he would be treated with leniency if he surrendered, Hu said.Meanwhile, a family member of murdered former Taoyuan county commissioner Liu Pang-yu (?????????) yesterday denied that Liu Pang-cheng was a cousin of the dead man, as some local media reports had claimed.Liu Pang-yu???s family lived in Taoyuan???s Jhongli (????¢G¢F) and Pingjhen (??????) districts, and although there are many people in the generation who carry the word Pang (???) in their given names, no one by the name Liu Pang-cheng is known to the family, the relative said.The family deeply mourns Liu Pang-yu and does not wish to see his reputation or that of his relatives tarnished by erroneous information, the relative said.Liu Pang-yu and six others were killed in an execution-style slaying at his residence on Nov. 21, 1996, a case that was never solved.Additional reporting by Lee Jung-ping",1
1,Front Page,"Hundreds of migrant workers and members of labor rights groups yesterday took to the streets of Taipei on the eve of Workers??? Day to urge the government to amend the law to improve working conditions and labor rights for migrant workers.Participants rallied in front of the Ministry of Labor at about noontime, calling on the ministry to meet three main demands, before setting off on a parade that ended on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building.The marchers held signs and banners in several languages, with messages such as ???against the government being employer-friendly and using the system to suppress migrant workers,??? ???do not abuse, migrant workers are humans too??? and ???stop sweatshop migrant labor, fight for equal labor rights.???The parade organizer, the Taiwan International Workers??? Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2
2,Front Page,"The Philippines followed up an ASEAN summit by releasing a final communique yesterday that removed mention of international concerns over China???s ???militarization??? of newly built islands in the disputed South China Sea in a major concession to Beijing.The 25-page statement issued by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte following the day-long meeting of ASEAN leaders that he hosted in Manila also made no direct mention of his country???s landmark arbitration victory against China last year.A vague reference to the ruling was removed from a part of the communique that discussed the long-seething territorial conflicts and moved elsewhere in the document.The changes were apparent based on a previous draft of the communique seen by reporters.A foreign diplomat based in Manila said that the Philippines circulated a stronger draft statement to other ASEAN members, which was backed by countries like Vietnam.Other governments made suggestions, but Duterte, as ASEAN chairman this year, could decide how to shape the language of the regional bloc???s ???chairman???s statement,??? said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the issue publicly.China and ASEAN member states Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, along with Taiwan, have overlapping claims to territory in the South China Sea.ASEAN, which makes decisions by consensus, has previously struggled to come up with statements on the issue, with Duterte???s predecessor often pushing for a tougher tone against China and getting pushback from Cambodia and Laos, unwilling to upset their largest trading partner and most important economic benefactor.China has dismissed and ignored the arbitration ruling handed down in July last year, which invalidated most of its historic claims to almost all of the South China Sea.Since taking office in June last year, Duterte has taken a much softer stance on China and the disputes than his predecessor.That was reflected in yesterday???s watered-down communique, which three Philippine officials said came at the request of Chinese diplomats in Manila.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.Former Philippine officials who dealt with the disputes say Duterte???s concessions to China could weaken the ability of the Philippines and other ASEAN members to seek Chinese compliance to the arbitration ruling and curb Beijing???s increasingly assertive behavior.???Our government, in its desire to fully and quickly accommodate our aggressive northern neighbor may have left itself negotiating a perilous road with little or no room to rely on brake power and a chance to shift gears if necessary,??? former Philippine foreign secretary Albert del Rosario said.",1

McMaster, reassured his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-jin, that the US alliance with South Korea was its top priority in the Asia-Pacific region, the South Korean presidential office said.The conversation followed another North Korean missile test-launch on Saturday, which Washington and Seoul said was unsuccessful.Trump, asked about his message to North Korea after the latest missile test, told reporters: ???You???ll soon find out,??? but did not elaborate on what the US response would be.Trump???s comments in an interview on Thursday that he wanted Seoul to pay for the THAAD deployment perplexed South Koreans and raised questions about his commitment to the two countries??? alliance.South Korean officials responded that the cost was for Washington to bear, under the bilateral agreement.???National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster explained that the recent statements by President Trump were made in a general context, in line with the US public expectations on defense cost burden-sharing with allies,??? the Blue House said in a statement, adding that McMaster requested the call.Major elements of the THAAD system were last week moved into the planned site in Seonjgu, in the south of the country.About 300 residents yesterday rallied as two US Army trucks tried to enter the deployment site.Video provided by villagers showed protesters blocking the road with a car and chanting slogans such as ???Don???t lie to us! Go back to your country!???Police said they had sent about 800 officers to the site and two residents were injured during clashes with them.Seoul and the US say the sole purpose of THAAD is to guard against North Korean missiles.",1

5,Taiwan News,"The nation???s military ties with the US have improved with frequent visits, while Taiwan is in the process of acquiring key defense systems from the US including attack helicopters, frigates and missile systems, the Ministry of National Defense said.About 1,000 US military officials made 140 visits to Taiwan last year, and about 900 Taiwanese military officials made 170 visits to the US for military exchanges and cooperation, according to a defense report to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review today.The report outlines goals and strategies to develop a new Taiwan-US framework in response to renewed US-China ties.The frequent bilateral visits suggest a close relationship between Taipei and Washington, and US officials have interacted with ministry officials, observed military exercises held by Taiwanese armed forces and helped evaluate the nation???s defense capabilities, the ministry said.???Bilateral military relations have expanded from the simple acquisition of ???hardware??? weapons to an interactive mechanism where ???software??? and ???hardware??? are given equal importance,??? the report says.It is the first time that the ministry has disclosed the number of officials involved in military exchanges between Taiwan and the US.Military exchanges with the US include 10 categories: policy discussion, arms sales, academic exchange, intelligence sharing, combat training, supply and logistics, cyberwarfare, armament management, defense capabilities evaluation and training.The ministry is to facilitate visits to Taiwan this fiscal year by high-level US military officials with policymaking authority in line with the US National Defense Authorization Act, which says that the US secretary of defense should enact a program of exchanges between senior Taiwanese and US military officers and officials to improve military-to-military relations.Following a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) last month, Washington has maintained regular interaction with Taipei in terms of security issues, and Taiwan is seeking to hold talks with the US concerning the US-China Comprehensive Dialogue framework set up to revamp the existing US-China structure.Nine arms deals are being conducted, including the acquisition of AH-64E Apache helicopters, UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates, AAV-7 Assault Amphibious Vehicles, short-range portable air-defense missile systems, Raytheon Phalanx close-in weapons systems and P-3C Orion aircraft, as well as upgrading the nation???s F-16 jets and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile systems.The acquisitions and upgrade are expected to substantially improve Taiwan???s overall defense capabilities, the report says.The ministry said it would seek to acquire more weapons from the US, although it is expected that Beijing would continue to manipulate cross-strait relations in a bid to influence US policy over arms sales to Taiwan.The ministry is also seeking active participation in the US??? new Asia-Pacific policy to contribute to regional cooperation, counterterrorism and humanitarian aid.",1

7,Taiwan News,"Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) chairmanship candidate Steve Chan (????????¢F) yesterday urged other candidates to refrain from capitalizing on Hon Hai Precision Industry Co chairman Terry Gou (?????¢X???), who has been mentioned as a potential KMT candidate for the presidential election in 2020.???A certain party chairperson candidate has been floating the idea, but it is irresponsible and demonstrates his lack of confidence,??? Chan said on Facebook, referring to KMT Vice Chairman Hau Lung-bin (?????????), who said he would nominate Gou as the party???s presidential candidate if he is elected KMT chairman.Chan said the KMT should not cling to wishful thinking and rely on people outside of the party to win the next presidential election, because a last-minute refusal from the candidate could disrupt the party???s campaign strategy and result in the nomination of an unsuitable candidate.That could lead to a repeat of what happened in last year???s presidential election campaign, during which the KMT replaced its original candidate, KMT Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu (????¡±???¡Ó), with New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu (??¡Ó??????) only three months before the vote due to Hung???s falling approval rating, Chan said.Touting his friendship with Gou, Chan said he contacted the businessman last year for a loan when the KMT was facing financial difficulties after its bank accounts were frozen by the Executive Yuan???s Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.???The incident goes to show our [close] relationship. We have talked about the 2020 race before, but Gou should be the one answering the question??? about whether he wants to represent the KMT in the next presidential election, Chan said.Gou???s mother loaned the KMT NT$45 million (US$1.49 million) in October last year when the party was struggling to pay its employees.Gou last week attracted public attention after he was filmed walking out of the White House on Thursday and Friday during a trip to Washington to discuss a potential investment in the US.The White House yesterday confirmed that Gou on Friday briefly met with US President Donald Trump.Chan said the KMT should engage in self-reflection and explore ways to attract talent from various sectors of society to join the party.The party should propose policies that would touch the voters, instead of capitalizing on Gou???s influence, he added.However, the Facebook post was edited hours later to remove the parts about Chan asking Gou for a loan and Hau capitalizing on the businessman.Hau yesterday again pointed at Gou as the only person that stands a chance of defeating President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) in the next presidential election.???A party leader should be selfless and think about nothing but ???winning.??? Recent polls have shown that Gou could defeat Tsai in a two-legged race. If surveys conducted near the 2020 election still suggest similar results, I will spare no efforts in persuading Gou to represent the party,??? Hau said.",1

Chang said.The government???s failure to allocate sufficient funds to official development assistance was a major obstacle to the nation???s efforts to convince other governments to support Taiwan in the WHO, he said.???We cannot attend the meetings empty-handed. Instead, we should have a compelling and professionally crafted cooperative strategy prepared after observing the needs of other nations and forming ties with their professionals,??? Chang said.This year, the assembly is to elect the successor to WHO Director-General Margaret Chen (???????¡Â????), who is to step down soon, he said.The candidates are Ethiopia???s former minister of health and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who represents Africa; Britain???s David Nabarro, a UN epidemiology consultant who represents Europe and the Americas; and Pakistan???s Sania Nishtar, a former federal minister of health who represents South Asia.Taiwan should consider the pre-election period an opportunity, because it is a test of WHO politics and sees a redistribution of power within the organization, Chang said, calling on the government to ???aggressively lobby??? all three candidates to support Taiwan.???The nation???s medical profession and the public expect Taiwan to have a role in the WHA, and the nation should unite and give it its best effort,??? he said. ???Even if this year???s outcome does not fully meet the nation???s expectations, the government has no room for fear, avoidance or doubt.???",1

10,Taiwan News,"The Directorate-General of Highways (DGH) yesterday said it might have to postpone the opening of the Tamkang Bridge (?¡P??¡Ó???¡±???) until after 2020 due to a lack of interest among construction firms in building it.The structure, which connects the Port of Taipei and Danhai New Town (?¡P???¡P??¢X??????), was once ridiculed as a bridge ???that would only emerge during election time,??? as many politicians made building it one of their key campaign promises.Construction of the 6km-long bridge began three years ago and was then estimated to cost NT$14.1 billion (US$466.67 million at current exchange rates). The DGH divided construction into three projects that were put up for tender.The first two, which involve building connecting roads at both sides of the bridge, were begun in October 2014 and January last year.However, the tender process for the construction of the main part of the bridge has failed three times, the DGH said.To facilitate the bidding process, the highway authority said that it is planning to raise the construction funds for the third project from NT$8.4 billion to NT$9.4 billion in the hopes of attracting qualified bidders at a tender session scheduled for May 23.The completion of the bridge would be set back until 2021 at the earliest, it said.The bridge, which is to be designed by London-based Zaha Hadid Architects, would be the world???s longest asymmetric cable-stayed bridge with a single pylon.Apart from car lanes, the highway authority said that it is to allocate space on the bridge for a light-rail system connecting New Taipei City???s Tamsui (?¡P??¢X?) and Bali (??????) districts.The Tamkang Bridge would help shorten the travel distance for people traveling between Tamsui and Bali by about 15km, shaving 25 minutes off their travel times.Travelers between the two  areas must now cross Guandu Bridge (????????¡±???) in Taipei???s Beitou District (??????).",1

The court is to issue its final judgment at the end of this month, at which time New Balance could get damages.New Balance senior global corporate communications manager Amy Dow confirmed the penalty, saying the brand used by all five was called New Boom.Dow said New Balance sued under China???s anti-unfair competition law, because the country???s trademark laws ???currently provide slight loopholes for these brands to exist.??????These actions are significantly more costly than traditional counterfeit enforcement measures, but New Balance believes strongly in the protection of our intellectual property,??? she said.Chinese manufacturers copy everything about a product, but with a slight modification of the brand name. For New Balance, that meant consumers ran into New Boom, New Barlun and New Bunren ??? brands that are protected under China???s trademark law.???Parasite brands are fast becoming the scariest form of ???counterfeit??? within China,??? Dow said in an e-mailed response.Dow said another Chinese court had awarded New Balance US$550,000 last month in a judgment against companies making New Bunren brand shoes.Separately, New Balance has an outstanding case against manufacturers using the brand New Barlun.",2

Pomeroy said. ???These cities will start to play a bigger and bigger role in the world economy, and understanding what is going on there will be even more important.???That means policymakers will have to balance the upsides of urbanization ??? economies of scale, better productivity and infrastructure, chance encounters that lead to new ideas, better productivity and infrastructure ??? with the potential downsides, in the shape of increased crime, pollution and perpetually snarled traffic.If that does not happen, these ill effects could sap economic potential, Pomeroy said.The urban areas experiencing the biggest increase in population will probably be in Africa.Kigali, Rwanda???s capital, is expected to see its population of 1.3 million double in the next 15 years.To help prepare for that the city has developed a master plan for transportation and housing, with the aim of being a slum-free city.By 2030, 81 of the world???s 100 most populous cities are to be in emerging markets.",1

There is no doubt the local real food movement is a mega-trend,??? said Tobias Peggs, one of the co-founders, a 45-year-old from Britain who previously worked in software.???If you are 20 today, food is bigger than the Internet was 20 years ago when we got on it,??? he said. ???Consumers want trust, they want to know their farmers.???He set up Square Roots with Kimbal Musk, brother of Tesla Inc chief executive officer Elon Musk, and they have been training 10 recruits since November last year.Already well-established in parts of Europe ??? the Netherlands in particular ??? the technology is still being pioneered in the US.The greens are reared in an entirely closed and artificial environment that can be completely controlled, grown vertically and irrigated by a hydroponic system that feeds them water mixed with minerals and nutrients.Wylie Goodman, a graduate student finishing a dissertation on urban farming at Cornell University, said New York was a captive market for the innovations.???It makes total sense,??? she said. ???You???ve got a well-educated and wealthy population willing to pay a lot for good local food??? ??? in this case US$7 per single pack of fresh greens delivered to your door.New York and its environs have seen constant innovation in urban agriculture from rooftop gardens to the huge AeroFarm complex in neighboring Newark and Gotham Greens, which grows greens and herbs in ultra-modern rooftop greenhouses that can be harvested before breakfast and on a New York plate for lunch.Halfway through his year-long apprenticeship, Peggs said the 10 young entrepreneurs have already learned how to grow food customers want to buy.The next stage will begin within a year, he said, with the creation of ???campuses??? capable of producing greens ??? similar to the one in Brooklyn ??? in other large US cities before the initiative rolls out ???everywhere.???His enthusiasm is contagious. About 100 people who took part in a guided tour of the farm this week were for the most part not only willing to shop the greens but also appeared to be mulling over setting up something similar.However, there are downsides to the business model.If indoor farms can be adapted to grow strawberries and blueberries, ???no one with a background in agriculture??? thinks they would replace traditional, soil-based farms, Goodman said.In addition, products with a denser biomass, such as cereals or beets, are out of reach for the moment.???If I grew beets, I would have to sell it for US$50 a head,??? Peggs said.The working conditions are also an issue.???Do you really want to work in an enclosed, glowing environment????

Zhou wrote in a note. ???On the other hand, the deleveraging effort by the Chinese authorities, has started to work.???The employment sub-index slipped to 49.2 from 50 in March while the raw materials inventories sub-index was unchanged at 48.3.Growth in China???s services sector slowed slightly to 54 last month, compared with the previous month???s reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014.China???s economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and the nation???s gravity-defying property boom.However, growth is expected to slow as authorities step up a battle to cool the property sector, and as the central bank and banking regulator take steps to contain financial risks.Some analysts say China???s economic growth might have peaked in the first quarter, but that it is on track to hit a target of about 6.5 percent this year.China???s producer price inflation in March cooled for the first time in seven months as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter, despite robust property investment.The private sector Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, is to be published tomorrow.The Caixin/Markit PMI is expected to come in at 51 for last month, according to a Reuters poll of economists, down from 51.2 in March.",1

It???s a dead weight,??? Angelino Ghinelli tweeted into a social media storm that has not gone unnoticed in Rome, where ministers have so far shown a strong reluctance to make any guarantees.???Enough with saving Alitalia,??? wrote Cinzia Briguglio, one of about 1,000 signatories to an online petition that sprang up last week, calling for the Italian government not to get involved.Consumer groups have also chimed in, including one, Codacons, which has threatened to ask Italy???s Corte dei Conti, a judicial auditor, to examine any state bailout.The court can fine officials, including ministers, for wasting public funds.An opinion poll published on Friday, four days after Alitalia workers voted to reject a union-backed rescue plan proposed by management, showed that 77 percent of Italians believed the airline should be left to fail.???It???s clear Italians are opposed to governments systematically running up deficits to deal with companies in crisis,???

Oxfam spokeswoman Manon Aubry told reporters.???When the world???s most powerful country decides to slash tax revenues as much as this, a number of other countries may follow suit, bringing with it imbalances that will have enormous impacts on our societies,??? she said.Falling tax revenues would make it harder for governments to pay for welfare, healthcare and other benefits without going too deep into the red, she said.To make up the shortfall, governments could be tempted to hike valued-added tax, often criticized for placing a disproportionate tax burden on the less well-off, Aubry said.???The cut in corporate taxes in the US will fuel tensions between countries,??? said Jean-Pierre Lieb, a tax lawyer at consultants EY.Corporate taxes in the US are the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, followed by France with a rate of 34 percent, Belgium with 33 percent and Australia with 30 percent. The OECD average is about 24 percent.However, to become more attractive, a number of countries have decided to lower their corporate tax rates.Britain is planning to cut its rate from 20 percent to 17 percent in 2020, a decision that predates Trump???s move and was strongly prompted by fears that corporations might find the UK less attractive place after it leaves the EU.There were even plans to cut the rate to 15 percent to help with Brexit woes, British papers have reported, but British Prime Minister Theresa May appears to have ruled out such a deep cut for now.France, meanwhile, is poised to take its corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 28 percent in 2020.Other countries, including Italy and Israel, have similar ambitions.???What we???re seeing is a headlong rush??? said Lieb, pointing to the case of Hungary where the corporate tax rate is to be slashed from 19 percent to just 9 percent.However, even if Trump succeeds in pushing through his planned cuts, countries such as Ireland, which have used their low tax rates to woo foreign companies like Google and Apple Inc, still expect to remain attractive.",1

30,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2
31,Editorials,"In February, former Executive Yuan director-general of personnel administration Chen Keng-chin (?????????) called on civil servants to ???milk their jobs??? and ???goof around??? as much as possible to drag down the government, but the nation???s chief executive, who should be the one most deeply insulted by Chen???s remark, said nothing.Protesters opposing pension reforms, who call themselves ???heroes,??? have been turning to violence and seem determined to take the nation down with them if their demands are not met, yet when police officers responsible for maintaining public order saw some of their retired former seniors among the rioters, they stood to attention and saluted.All the government???s talk of harshly punishing those who use violence is useless if the authorities appear so weak.In November last year, a group of retired generals went on a friendly visit to an enemy nation, where they sat and listened to instructions from that nation???s head of state and stood in respect for its national anthem ??? common sense and the Ministry of Defense???s own definition will tell you which enemy country we are talking about.Yet the commander-in-chief of Taiwan???s armed forces, who, again, should be the one most deeply insulted, had nothing to say.Living in today???s Taiwan, one often gets the feeling that important elements of the nation have gotten out of control, and it is hard to tell whether anyone is actually in charge.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???), who was elected by a majority, seems to be growing more and more distant from the public. Sadly, the public???s impression of her is that whenever she makes a speech, be it on a big or small occasion and no matter whether her speech is long or short, she is always clutching a script from which she reads every word without ever raising her eyes.When the speaker is uninspiring, the listener is uninspired. Tsai no longer shows any sign of her lively and friendly side, or of her wisdom as a prominent intellectual.National leaders??? success might stem from their verbal skill, their charisma, their good governance or their closeness to the public. How can Tsai put this nation back on its feet, establish democratic discipline and foster decent public behavior? I humbly and sincerely offer the following suggestions:First, the president should climb out of her ivory tower, meet people face to face and engage in frank and honest dialogue with her constituents.Second, she should greatly reduce the amount of ???state secrets.??? The more secrets there are, the more doubtful and suspicious the public will be. Most ???secrets??? are really unnecessary and only serve to satisfy the sense of superiority of a handful of people who have a monopoly on the information.The government should not just let the public know how things are, but also why things are the way they are. For example, what would be the harm in calling China ???China??? and Taiwan ???Taiwan????What harm would it do if the legislature passed a normal referendum law like those of other democratic nations? What harm would come from freezing or abolishing the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Taiwan Provincial Government? What negative impact could answering these questions possibly have on ???national security????Third, Taiwan could set a trend by doing something even advanced democracies have not done. Tsai could expand on the examples of former US presidents Franklin Roosevelt???s ???fireside chats??? and Ronald Reagan???s weekly presidential broadcasts by having national TV and radio stations set aside an hour every Sunday for a dialogue between the president and the public.",1
32,Editorials,"Two important bills have passed their third readings in the legislature. One was an amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act (????????????), passed on April 20, and the other was an amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act (?????¢F???????????????), which was passed on Tuesday. These two amendments have the same purpose: to secure financing for Taiwan???s long-term care services.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has exerted a great deal of effort in pushing the amendments and those aged 60 and older are certain to feel the benefits. However, looking at what kind of policies should be made a priority in terms of national development, this is policy for older people and it is less urgent than coming up with policies for the young.The two amendments originated with changes to the Long-Term Care Services Act (??¡P?????¡±??¡±?????????) passed last year, according to which long-term care should be financed by the tobacco, estate and gift taxes.The amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act adds NT$20 (US$0.66) to the tax on every pack of cigarettes, which will now total NT$31.8 per pack. According to the government???s calculations, this will contribute NT$23.346 billion to long-term care every year.The amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act changes the tax rate from a flat 10 percent to a three-tiered incremental tax of 10, 15 and 20 percent. The government estimates that this would contribute NT$6.3 billion to long-term care per year.Two legislative sessions have passed since the DPP government took office and since these are the bills it has focused on, it is clear that they constitute its main policy focus.The increase in the tobacco tax is aimed at public health issues such as tobacco hazard prevention, something most people can agree with.However, the estate and gift tax adjustments set off a wave of calls to reduce taxes, after the government???s policy direction became clear last year. The calls have extended to calls for adjustment to the taxes on cash, shares, real estate and insurance.Since neither Singapore nor Hong Kong or the rest of China have an estate tax, there have even been examples of wealthy people voting with their feet to protect their property. Experience bears this out: After the estate tax was cut to 10 percent in 2009, the government???s fiscal revenue remained about the same as it was before the amendment, when the tax stood at 50 percent.In other words, this source of fiscal revenue is unstable and it is questionable if the Ministry of Finance???s estimates will be met. It will be necessary to pay attention to the effect this will have on capital.However, these issues are not the point of this editorial. Considering Taiwan???s problems, more attention should be given to policies aimed at the young instead of focusing on the elderly. At the very least, the two groups should be given the same weight.If priority is given to policies for the elderly, that could remove all room for policies for young people. That would be a great mistake.The danger posed to Taiwan by a falling birth rate and an aging population is common knowledge. Let us leave aside immigration policies for the moment and focus on these two issues alone.We cannot stop people from growing old or reduce the number of elderly people, so if we are to change the demographic structure, there is only one way to go: encouraging families to have children.",1
33,Editorials,"The nation???s economic achievements were once internationally renowned, but economic growth has widened the ever-expanding gap between rich and poor.The lack of a bicameral legislature, of effective supervision of the executive offices and of government oversight in balanced regional development has caused cities that once flourished economically to decline in administrative functionality simply because of their distance from the capital.As young people migrate to Taipei with the promise of higher salaries, other cities continue to become more marginalized.Take Pingtung for example: the nation???s southernmost city, which has seen a population reduction of 46,930 people since 2010. The political and economic center of Taipei has been unconcerned with the city at the island???s southern tip since the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) moved to Taiwan from China.Pingtung has received proportionally far fewer national resources than other large cities. Many people in the city are concerned that it is becoming increasingly lethargic and that they might soon lose a legislative representative, which would reduce the say of Pingtung???s people in the Legislative Yuan.In the absence of ???economic human rights??? and protection from the federal government under the constitutional system, the decline of Pingtung epitomizes the nation???s economic development.It is unfortunate that this phenomenon has failed to garner the attention of the media, which are mostly located in Taipei, making Pingtung???s unbalanced development even more invisible to officials in the capital.A group has filed a petition through the government petition platform for the high-speed railway to be extended to Pingtung (https://goo.gl/34qnUM).The petition as of yesterday had been signed by 6,055 people, reaching the platform???s threshold within a week, whereas typically only about 4.7 percent of petitions are able to meet the requirements.The strong voice of these people has gathered great interest and attention from Taiwanese. The Pingtung County commissioner, as well as several social activism groups, have echoed the petition???s call to raise awareness about the importance of communication construction in Pingtung.Pingtung residents have come together on this issue, hoping for more balanced regional development and equality in economic rights. They believe that the government???s investment in communication infrastructure would be an important symbol of the government???s willingness to improve regional imbalance and economic inequality.For decades, Taipei has been the prime subject of consideration for resources and government policies. It does not favor local industrial transformation and innovation when talent and resources are concentrated in metropolitan regions.As most corporate headquarters and funds are concentrated in Taipei, other regions are forced to face population loss, lack of funding for infrastructure and fewer employment opportunities.As the economies in these regions continue to suffer, the gap between rich and poor continues to increase. Such hardships would undoubtedly become long-term challenges for rural regions.It is therefore all the more critical to come up with strategies to face these challenges, to eliminate domestic inequality and opposition, and to form alliances with other nations on the basis of the common goal of attaining regional balance and equal opportunity for all.",1
34,Editorials,"At a time when South Korea is struggling to deter North Korea???s nuclear threats, human rights advocates say its military is targeting gay soldiers in its ranks.In recent weeks, the army has focused on dozens of those soldiers in what rights groups say is a campaign against gay men in the 620,000-member military.At least 32 have faced criminal charges of ???sodomy or other disgraceful conduct,??? according to the domestic news media and lawyers and rights advocates familiar with the cases.On Tuesday night, the issue of gay rights became a focus in South Korea???s presidential race, when the candidate who leads in the polls, Moon Jae-in, joined some of the other contenders in saying that he opposed homosexuality.Critics said the statement was a tactic to win support among conservative voters.Moon made the comment during a debate in which the issue of the military???s treatment of gays was raised. Under the conscript system, all eligible men are required to serve about two years.However, the Military Criminal Act outlaws sodomy and other unspecified ???disgraceful conduct??? between servicemen, whether or not there is mutual consent and whether or not that conduct takes place on military compounds. Those found to have violated the act face up to two years in prison.The army declined to provide details on its investigation.However, it said that it was not cracking down on gay soldiers; instead it said that it was trying to root out sodomy and other homosexual activities, which right-wing Christian groups have called a growing blight on its readiness to fight North Korea???s 1.2 million-member military.However, in the past week, evidence has emerged to support the allegations by gay soldiers that investigators flouted the army???s own regulations on how to treat gay service members by preying upon the soldiers??? fear of shame and abuse if they are outed in the military.Analysts and veterans said bullying, hazing and sexual violence were chronic problems in the South Korean army.In a series of telephone conversations secretly recorded in March and last month, an army investigator warned a gay sergeant against seeking help from lawyers or the National Human Rights Commission of Korea.In one conversation, the investigator complained that another gay soldier refused to cooperate with the inquiry and wanted to hire a lawyer.???If he hires a lawyer, that means he is outing himself,??? the investigator says in the recording, uploaded to the Web site of the Seoul-based Military Human Rights Center for Korea.It is unknown how many gay soldiers were punished under the anti-sodomy law before the recent flurry of charges.Gay soldiers said they feared that they were being scapegoated in the recent inquiry as part of an effort by the army to contain sexual abuse.In a survey of 671 veterans commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission in 2004, more than 15 percent said they had been sexually abused.Advocates say that by punishing gay soldiers, the government was sending the wrong message in South Korea, where the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are a largely taboo and politically unpopular subject. Powerful right-wing Christian groups have intensified a campaign against homosexuality, scuttling a bill that would have given sexual minorities the same protection as other minorities.",1
35,Editorials,"North Korea observers have long marveled at the ability of a small, impoverished, autocratic nation to go toe-to-toe with the world???s superpowers.Part of the secret to North Korea???s success has always been the ruling Kim family???s mastery of the art of brinkmanship.What looks to outsiders like bluster, bombast and recklessness is actually a proven technique that over the years has won North Korea grudging respect from Washington and its allies, and has at times filled its coffers with aid offered by rivals relieved to see animosity on the Korean Peninsula ease.However, the roles might have reversed, with a new administration in Washington bulldozing its way to the brink before finally backing away.Korean war jitters made global headlines after US President Donald Trump issued repeated, ambiguous warnings about his willingness to take unilateral action and sent US military vessels to Korean waters.However, last week, Trump announced a much softer policy that combines diplomacy and economic sanctions and is strikingly similar to what frustrated past US presidents embraced.North Korea used to employ a comparable method: forcing the world to pay attention by staging nuclear and missile tests, issuing outrageous threats and occasionally lashing out with violence ??? and then offering negotiations.For decades, the tiny, Third-World dictatorship sandwiched between rich behemoths played the game remarkably well.However, some now see North Korea entering a frightening new phase, barreling across what were once considered ???red lines??? in a dash to build nuclear-armed missiles that can reach the US mainland.Here is a brief examination of North Korea???s mastery of brinkmanship and what might be coming next:US BRINKMANSHIP?Brinkmanship can be defined as the technique of pushing a dangerous policy to the edge of safety before stopping.Some Korea experts, analyzing what happened in recent weeks on the Korean Peninsula, believe that this time Washington engineered the brinkmanship.Presumably worried that North Korea would soon conduct its sixth nuclear test, the Trump administration threatened a possible attack, ordered a supercarrier and nuclear-powered submarine to Korea and linked the US bombing of Syria to North Korea.???They were putting the idea of a surprise military action out there, which is the definition of a dangerous policy on the Korean Peninsula,??? John Delury, an Asia expert and professor at Seoul???s Yonsei University, said of the US moves.Trump seemed to think he could pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons and, if that failed, would then consider a pre-emptive strike, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul???s Dongguk University.North Korea, for its part, was relatively restrained, analysts said.Yes, North Korea expressed anger, as it does every year, over annual springtime joint military exercises by Seoul and Washington that the North calls preparations for an invasion.However, its response did not go beyond what happens most years. That included bellicose threats, a [failed] missile test linked to the celebration of the birthday of North Korea???s founder Kim Il-sung and war games during the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People???s Army.NUCLEAR AND MISSILE TESTSA big part of North Korea???s past brinkmanship has always involved its weapons program.

It has helped me a great deal that I can occasionally just go galloping into the woods with my friends. It somehow balances my mind.???Like a real horse and its rider, the hobbyhorse and its master form a team and become attached to each other. Similarly, the sports simulates traditional equestrian events including competing in dressage and show jumping, and is physically demanding.Some actual horse riders may look down on hobby-horsing as childlike past-time not suitable for anyone aged over 10, but Equestrian Federation of Finland secretary-general Fred Sundwall disagrees.???We think it???s simply wonderful that hobby-horsing has become a phenomenon and so popular,??? Sundwall said. ???It gives a chance to those children and teens who don???t own horses to interact with them also outside stables and riding schools.???The vast majority of the hobbyhorses are homemade ???splendid, colorful creatures complete with names like Chattanooga Choo Choo and Panda ??? exchanged and sold by owners at events and through social media. Some of them have been known to fetch up to 200 euros (US$218 dollars) at auctions.Aficionados take high pride in the sport???s do-it-yourself attitude and very few industrially made hobbyhorses are seen at events because they are ???lower-caste horses,??? said Venla-Maria Uutela, a spokeswoman for a registered informal hobbyhorse society in Helsinki.About 10,000 people, nearly all of them between the ages of 10 and 18, are estimated to be involved in hobby-horsing in Finland. Its popularity is also growing steadily in the other Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe, though the numbers are much smaller.Regional competition events are arranged and organized by volunteers throughout Finland, culminating in national championships every year.This year???s main event took place late this month at a packed sports hall in Helsinki, attracting an estimated 1,000 spectators to watch about 200 participants competing with their hobbyhorses in several subcategories.???It???s very bizarre for other people to see, for the first time especially, this kind of stuff,??? said Taija Turkki, an 18-year-old hobbyhorse coach. ???Because they think we think the horse is alive, which we do not. We understand that it???s dead, made of fabric and all that.???Lack of strict rules and pompous ceremonies, strong social media presence and female bonding are a big part of the attraction.???Freedom to create and imagination are key aspects into why people start hobby-horsing,??? said Aarniomaki, a hobbyhorse veteran who does not compete actively anymore, but is keen on organizing related events such as a recent hobbyhorse parade through the streets of Helsinki.",1

41,Sports,"It never happened in the decade when the prosaic nature of his heavyweight domination quite underwhelmed boxing, but, at the age of 41, Wladimir Klitschko on Saturday belatedly earned proper appreciation for his greatness.How ironic, though, that it had to come in defeat.The veteran Ukrainian warrior came agonizingly close to becoming only the second fighter after George Foreman to win a recognized version of the world title as a forty-something before being stopped by Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium in London.Bruised, battered and with a deep cut by his left eye, he could only reflect ruefully on having failed to follow up his sixth round knock-down of Joshua aggressively enough, feeling he had let the Briton off the hook.Yet, although a 14-year age gap and Joshua???s fitness, strength and power eventually saw him floored twice and finally rescued by the referee in the 11th round, Klitschko still felt like a winner at the end of an exhilarating evening.Ninety thousand fans at Wembley seemed to agree as the man who was so often damned with faint praise during 11 years of heavyweight dominance received much greater acclaim here than he had after many of his mundane victories.Often portrayed as being too safety-first and mechanical in approach, here was a very different ???Dr Steelhammer,??? stung into desperate defiance after Joshua had sent him crashing to his knees with a fifth-round assault.It looked for all money like the end for the man who had appeared well past his sell-by-date in a sorry dethroning at the hands of Tyson Fury some 17 months earlier, but as Klitschko himself said: ???I took a beating, but I recovered well.???Indeed, in what was perhaps the most courageous couple of minutes in his two-decade professional career, Klitschko fought back dazzlingly, one big left hook setting up a counter-attack so ferocious that by the end of the round it was Joshua who was looking almost out on his feet.After following up with a booming right cross in the next which saw Joshua felled for the first time in his professional career, Klitschko made what he felt was a crucial, fight-turning error.???I thought he wouldn???t get up. Big respect to AJ. From that moment, I think I should have done more straight after he went down,??? he said. ???But I was pretty sure it was going to be my night so I took my time.???Big mistake. Joshua was given a breather and when he clawed his way back in the later stages, finding a ???second wind,??? his wicked body shots began to sap Klitschko???s stamina, setting up the painful denouement.As the Wembley crowd cheered him afterward, though, Klitschko started to appreciate that the historic contest had elevated the reputations of all involved.???I think Joshua and I both did great, I think we did a lot for the sport in the way we performed and how we respected and treated each other,??? he said. ???It was a great night for boxing and the fans. You will probably be surprised by my statement, but I don???t feel like I lost.??????Tonight, we all won. I didn???t get the belts but I didn???t feel like I lost ??? not my name, my face, nor my reputation. It was great to be involved in such an amazing occasion,??? Klitschko said.This did not sound like a man who was quite ready to hang up his gloves and he had not looked like one either as he often outboxed his old sparring partner, teaching Joshua more in one night than he had learned in his other 18 bouts combined.",1

Lundqvist could not stop Jean-Gabriel Pageau, Ottawa???s unlikely hero.Pageau scored twice in the final four minutes of regulation to bring the Senators back from a two-goal deficit and capped the 6-5 comeback in the second overtime with his fourth goal of the game.???We played a strong game; we just came up a little bit short,??? a somber Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said.Ottawa has a two-games-to-none lead in this second-round series.Game 3 is played tomorrow in New York.Lundqvist and his teammates appeared to be headed for a series-tying win before Pageau ??? who scored only 12 goals in the regular season ??? notched his second goal of the game at 16 minutes, 41 seconds of the third period, then finished his hat trick at 18 minutes 58 seconds when Senators goalie Craig Anderson was pulled for an extra attacker.In the first overtime, the Rangers had a golden opportunity to escape with a victory when Rick Nash took the puck from Anderson behind the net.Nash had a chance to put it in, but it was poked away by Senators forward Kyle Turris.Nash???s squandered chance came after a stunning reversal in a third period that began with the Rangers seemingly assured of heading back to Madison Square Garden with the series tied at a game apiece.A strong second period had yielded three Rangers goals and a 4-2 lead, the kind that Lundqvist has been more than capable of defending.Michael Grabner opened the scoring for the Rangers with a short-handed goal at 4 minutes 16 seconds of the first, and Pageau tied the score with an unassisted goal at 13 minutes 59 seconds.The Rangers dominated the second period.Anderson had to make a flurry of early saves, stopping a frustrated J.T. Miller from close range with a virtual open net behind him.Miller, who has one assist and no goals in the playoffs, smacked his stick against the glass after he was denied.However, Chris Kreider ??? who made his Rangers debut during the 2012 first-round series against the Senators and also had been quiet in the playoffs ??? put his team ahead at 10 minutes 39 seconds off assists from Mika Zibanejad and Ryan McDonagh.Kreider shouted in delight as he celebrated his breakthrough moment along the boards.When he settled on the Rangers??? bench, Zibanejad, a former Senator, hugged him and planted a kiss on Kreider???s white helmet.Penguins 6, Capitals 2AP, WashingtonPhil Kessel scored twice, Sidney Crosby set up more goals and the Pittsburgh Penguins chased Braden Holtby on the way to a 6-2 victory over Washington Capitals in Game 2 that gave them a commanding 2-0 lead in their second-round series.Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 34 of the 36 shots he faced for Pittsburgh, which also got goals by Matt Cullen, Jake Guentzel and Evgeni Malkin.The Penguins scored three goals on 14 shots on Holtby, who was pulled in favor of Philipp Grubauer after the second period.",1

46,World News,"British Prime Minister Theresa May yesterday said that divorce talks with the EU would be difficult, responding to the tough stance taken by EU leaders over the upcoming Brexit negotiations.EU leaders on Saturday endorsed stiff divorce terms for Britain and warned Britons to have ???no illusions??? about swiftly securing a new relationship to keep their access to EU markets.???What this shows, and what some of the other comments we???ve seen coming from European leaders shows, is that there are going to times when these negotiations are going to be tough,??? May told the BBC.May also reaffirmed her position that she would be prepared to walk away from the talks on leaving the EU without a deal if she did not like what was on offer from Brussels.At the Brussels summit, which was marked by unusual harmony among the 27 leaders, there was a flash of the cross-Channel acrimony which some fear could wreck any deal when officials accused London of cynically vetoing some EU spending and demanded it back down or face disrupting the start of talks next month.Meeting for the first time since May triggered the two-year countdown to Brexit in late March, her counterparts took just minutes as they sat down to lunch in Brussels to approve eight pages of negotiating guidelines hammered out by their diplomats over the past month.They greeted the decision with applause, officials said.The text will bind Michel Barnier, their chief negotiator, to seek a deal that secures the rights of 3 million EU expatriates living in Britain, ensures London pays tens of billions of euros Brussels thinks it will be owed, and avoids destabilizing peace by creating a hard EU-UK border across the island of Ireland.???We are ready,??? Barnier said. ???We are together.???With Barnier expecting to launch negotiations after the June 8 election that May called to strengthen her position, the EU leaders also firmly ruled out discussing the free trade deal May wants until they see ???significant progress??? on key withdrawal terms.???Before discussing the future, we have to sort out our past,??? summit chair and European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters.He criticized British politicians ??? who have included May ??? for speaking of a quick deal to reassure expatriates when the legal complexities required much more detailed talks.???We need a serious British response,??? Tusk said.In London, Britain???s minister for leaving the EU said he wanted the negotiations to be conducted in a ???spirit of goodwill.??????But there is no doubt that these negotiations are the most complex the UK has faced in our lifetimes.

David Davis said in a statement in response to the guidelines.German Chancellor Angela Merkel repeated her concern that some in Britain had ???illusions??? about quick trade talks.???I sometimes feel some people in Britain, and I don???t mean the government, are not so clear on the idea that there is an exit phase and then a phase on the future relationship,??? she said.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker took an even more combative tone, saying his officials had identified a ???cocktail??? of 25 different legal issues to settle just regarding expatriate residence rights.???I have the impression sometimes that our British friends ??? not all of them ??? underestimate the technical difficulties we have to face,??? he told reporters, three days after he and Barnier met May over dinner in London for ???constructive??? talks.",1
47,World News,"Thousands of people across the US on Saturday marched in rain, snow and sweltering heat to demand action on climate change ??? mass protests that coincided with US President Donald Trump???s 100th day in office and took aim at his agenda for rolling back environmental protections.At the marquee event, the People???s Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands of demonstrators made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue on their way to encircle the White House as temperatures soared into the 30s?C.Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco.A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city???s federal plaza to Trump Tower.???We are here because there is no Planet B,??? the Reverend Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told a rally in Boston.The demonstrations came one week after supporters of science gathered in 600 cities around the globe, alarmed by political and public rejection of established research on topics including climate change and the safety of vaccines.Participants on Saturday said they object to Trump???s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things.Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame.Among those attending the Chicago rally were members of the union representing US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees.Trump has proposed cutting the EPA???s budget by almost one-third, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs.American Federation of Government Employees Council 238 president John O???Grady called the march ???a chance to speak out in unity against this administration??? and its ???ridiculous gutting of the EPA budget and staffing.???More than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe.???I???ve seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,??? lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine, said.People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood.Saharlah Farah, a 16-year old immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could have a bigger toll on marginalized groups that have less financial resources.???But I see untapped power here today,??? she said.A demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Florida, where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city.",1
48,World News,"Faced with exploding populations and steadily rising temperatures worldwide, cities must make haste in reinforcing defenses against climate change-induced flooding and heat waves, experts said last week.City temperatures are forecast to shoot up in the coming years, exposing inhabitants to killer heat spikes, while rising sea levels and river flooding threaten homes, drinking water, and transport and electricity infrastructure.Cities are vulnerable to a unique risk called the ???urban heat island??? (UHI) effect ??? their concrete surfaces retain more of the sun???s heat than undeveloped areas, scientists said at a meeting in Vienna of the European Geosciences Union (EGU).By midcentury, if planet-warming fossil fuel emissions continue unabated, city temperatures in Belgium could exceed today???s heat-alert levels by as much as 10?C for 25 days each summer, according to one research paper.Another study showed that heat waves will become a frequent challenge for European cities ??? more numerous in the south of the continent, more intense in the north.Floods, a major risk to Europe???s dense urban settlements, will become more common because of an increase in freak rainstorms, as well as sea-level increases caused by polar ice melt and warmer ocean water expanding.In flood-prone Southeast Asia, precipitation is set to increase by 20 percent this century, one researcher said in Vienna.The stakes are especially high given the projections for expansion of urban areas, which are often ill equipped to deal with nature???s vengeance.Already, more than half the world???s population live in cities. By 2050, 80 percent of people in rich nations, and 60 percent in developing states, will be concentrated in built-up areas, according to recent calculations.This corresponds to the appearance of a settlement of 1 million inhabitants somewhere on the globe every week for the next 40 years.Occupying only a small portion of Earth???s available land, cities are responsible for 80 percent of all energy consumed and generate more than 60 percent of the planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted when humans burn fossil fuel for heating, power and transportation.In spite of efforts to curb emissions, the planet has already warmed about 1?C on average from pre-Industrial Revolution levels.Many scientists say the planet may be on track for 3?C of warming or more, exceeding the 2?C cap politicians set in Paris in 2015.This means cities must act now to shore up their defenses against impacts that can no longer be avoided, French climatologist Herve le Treut said at the annual EGU gathering.???It???s already happening,??? Le Treut said of climate change impacts. ???We have to start structural action quickly: transportation, houses... mainly in the cities, especially in vulnerable places.???Most of the infrastructure constructed by humanity is in urban zones.???The ways cities are built is not optimal??? for today???s climate reality, said Daniel Schertzer, a hydrometeorologist at the engineering school Ecole des Ponts ParisTech.???Historically, humans have settled near water, thinking of its usefulness, but not of the risk! Cities were conceived without taking geophysics into consideration, now they are discovering that nature is complicated, not just good,??? he said on the sidelines of the conference.Paris, for example, is due for its next so-called one-in-a hundred-year flood. The last major Paris flood, in 1910, saw the Seine river rise 8.62m, shutting down much of the City of Light???s basic infrastructure.",1

Yeung said.Hong Kong???s next leader Carrie Lam (???????????¢D) ??? hated by pro-democracy activists ??? will also be sworn in on July 1. She has vowed to heal divisions, but critics say the festivities are unlikely to help.Art works from the Louvre, Egyptian mummies from the British Museum and an exhibition from Beijing???s Palace Museum will be on show as part of the celebrations.

53,Features,"Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, is launching a new online publication which will aim to fight fake news by pairing professional journalists with an army of volunteer community contributors.Wikitribune plans to pay for the reporters by raising money from a crowdfunding campaign.Wales intends to cover general issues, such as US and UK politics, through to specialist science and technology.Those who donate will become supporters, who in turn will have a say in which subjects and story threads the site focuses on. And Wales intends that the community of readers will fact-check and subedit published articles.Describing Wikitribune as ???news by the people and for the people,??? Wales said: ???This will be the first time that professional journalists and citizen journalists will work side-by-side as equals writing stories as they happen, editing them live as they develop, and at all times backed by a community checking and rechecking all facts.???Although the site is launching at the beginning of the UK general election campaign, Wales said the impetus for the project came from the US.???Someone I know convinced me to give Trump 100 days before making my mind up,??? he said, ???but then on day one Kellyanne Conway came out and said her ???alternative facts??? line. That was when I really decided to move forward.???If the fundraising campaign goes well, Wales hopes to be able to hire the site???s first journalists ???as soon as possible??? ??? perhaps before June 8, when Britons vote in the general election called by prime minister Theresa May.Like Wikipedia, Wales???s new project will be free to access. The publication is launched last month with a crowdfunding campaign pre-selling monthly ???support packages??? to fund the initial journalists. The first issue will follow soon after.The community contributors will play a key part in the new site, ensuring that the content of the articles are always supported by as much extra information shared with the readers as possible.They will be backed up by a presumption of transparency in the site???s reporting, with journalists sharing full transcripts, video and audio of interviews.He hopes that a combination of the distributed intelligence of Wikipedia and measured professional journalism driven by a business model ???that???s not about chasing clicks??? will lead to a news organization built from the ground up to combat fake news and political rabble-rousing.There is a third way, he said, between the two models ???of he said, she said faux neutrality, or having a Paul Dacre [editor of the Daily Mail] agenda and ramming things down our throats.???He added: ???If you take a look at Wikipedia, it???s noisy and not a perfect place, but for true fake news, there???s been almost no impact on the Wikipedia community.???The volunteers are experienced enough to know it???s nonsense, and have an ethos saying: ???No, we???re here for neutral facts???: that community knows it from the ground up.???Those contributors who also support the site financially will eventually be able to advise on the topics they want Wikitribune to explore, Wales said.???If you take as an example the bitcoin community, they???re a very active and obsessed community.???There???s a lot of news that comes out in the field, and I think they???d love to be able to raise money to hire a journalist and put them on the bitcoin/blockchain beat.???",1

56,Front Page,"An exchange of gunfire and a three-hour standoff with police ended safely yesterday as a suspected organized crime member surrendered to police in New Taipei City???s Jhonghe District (??????).No casualties were reported, the New Taipei City Police Department said.The gunman, identified as Liu Pang-cheng (?????????), is the suspected leader of a drug ring and a chapter head of the Celestial Way (?????????) gang, the department said.Sindian (??¢X???) Precinct polivr had Liu under surveillance for some time because he was suspected of heading a narcotics ring and using drugs to recruit addicts to be dealers, it said.Officers tried to apprehend him yesterday morning after an arrest warrant was issued, the department said.Liu resisted arrest and fled toward Jhonghe with the police in pursuit, leading to a firefight on the streets in which 30 shots were exchanged, police said.Liu then entered a residence on Lane 410, Jingsin Street (??¡Â??¢X???), it said.The police officers who had been pursing Liu retreated some distance from the building and a SWAT team was called in to cordon off the alley and warn local residents before negotiations began, the department said.Liu supposedly had a grenade in addition to guns and threatened to commit suicide during the negotiations.He also demanded to see his girlfriend, who police escorted to the scene to talk with Liu after putting body armor on her.After three hours of negotiations, Liu laid down his weapons and surrendered, police said.Liu is also a suspect in several violent crimes reportedly connected to urban development projects in Taipei???s Zhongshan District (????¡Ó¡Ó) and the attempted blackmail of a man surnamed Shao (???) for NT$3 million (US$99,279), police said.During the standoff, the police department???s priority was protecting bystanders and local residents, and triple security lines were established to keep residents from being taken hostage, Criminal Investigation Corps Commander Liao Hsun-cheng (?????????) said.New Taipei City Police Department Commissioner Hu Mu-yuan (?????????) said Liu had apparently acted out of fear of facing 18 years or more in prison for resisting arrest, drugs and other charges.Officers talking with Liu kept telling him that he would not be sentenced to life in prison or to death and that he would be likely to receive parole if he behaves well in prison, Hu said.A prosecutor who was also at the scene told Liu that he would be treated with leniency if he surrendered, Hu said.Meanwhile, a family member of murdered former Taoyuan county commissioner Liu Pang-yu (?????????) yesterday denied that Liu Pang-cheng was a cousin of the dead man, as some local media reports had claimed.Liu Pang-yu???s family lived in Taoyuan???s Jhongli (????¢G¢F) and Pingjhen (??????) districts, and although there are many people in the generation who carry the word Pang (???) in their given names, no one by the name Liu Pang-cheng is known to the family, the relative said.The family deeply mourns Liu Pang-yu and does not wish to see his reputation or that of his relatives tarnished by erroneous information, the relative said.Liu Pang-yu and six others were killed in an execution-style slaying at his residence on Nov. 21, 1996, a case that was never solved.Additional reporting by Lee Jung-ping",1
57,Front Page,"Hundreds of migrant workers and members of labor rights groups yesterday took to the streets of Taipei on the eve of Workers??? Day to urge the government to amend the law to improve working conditions and labor rights for migrant workers.Participants rallied in front of the Ministry of Labor at about noontime, calling on the ministry to meet three main demands, before setting off on a parade that ended on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building.The marchers held signs and banners in several languages, with messages such as ???against the government being employer-friendly and using the system to suppress migrant workers,??? ???do not abuse, migrant workers are humans too??? and ???stop sweatshop migrant labor, fight for equal labor rights.???The parade organizer, the Taiwan International Workers??? Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2
58,Front Page,"The Philippines followed up an ASEAN summit by releasing a final communique yesterday that removed mention of international concerns over China???s ???militarization??? of newly built islands in the disputed South China Sea in a major concession to Beijing.The 25-page statement issued by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte following the day-long meeting of ASEAN leaders that he hosted in Manila also made no direct mention of his country???s landmark arbitration victory against China last year.A vague reference to the ruling was removed from a part of the communique that discussed the long-seething territorial conflicts and moved elsewhere in the document.The changes were apparent based on a previous draft of the communique seen by reporters.A foreign diplomat based in Manila said that the Philippines circulated a stronger draft statement to other ASEAN members, which was backed by countries like Vietnam.Other governments made suggestions, but Duterte, as ASEAN chairman this year, could decide how to shape the language of the regional bloc???s ???chairman???s statement,??? said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the issue publicly.China and ASEAN member states Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, along with Taiwan, have overlapping claims to territory in the South China Sea.ASEAN, which makes decisions by consensus, has previously struggled to come up with statements on the issue, with Duterte???s predecessor often pushing for a tougher tone against China and getting pushback from Cambodia and Laos, unwilling to upset their largest trading partner and most important economic benefactor.China has dismissed and ignored the arbitration ruling handed down in July last year, which invalidated most of its historic claims to almost all of the South China Sea.Since taking office in June last year, Duterte has taken a much softer stance on China and the disputes than his predecessor.That was reflected in yesterday???s watered-down communique, which three Philippine officials said came at the request of Chinese diplomats in Manila.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.Former Philippine officials who dealt with the disputes say Duterte???s concessions to China could weaken the ability of the Philippines and other ASEAN members to seek Chinese compliance to the arbitration ruling and curb Beijing???s increasingly assertive behavior.???Our government, in its desire to fully and quickly accommodate our aggressive northern neighbor may have left itself negotiating a perilous road with little or no room to rely on brake power and a chance to shift gears if necessary,??? former Philippine foreign secretary Albert del Rosario said.",1

Chan said on Facebook, referring to KMT Vice Chairman Hau Lung-bin (?????????), who said he would nominate Gou as the party???s presidential candidate if he is elected KMT chairman.Chan said the KMT should not cling to wishful thinking and rely on people outside of the party to win the next presidential election, because a last-minute refusal from the candidate could disrupt the party???s campaign strategy and result in the nomination of an unsuitable candidate.That could lead to a repeat of what happened in last year???s presidential election campaign, during which the KMT replaced its original candidate, KMT Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu (????¡±???¡Ó), with New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu (??¡Ó??????) only three months before the vote due to Hung???s falling approval rating, Chan said.Touting his friendship with Gou, Chan said he contacted the businessman last year for a loan when the KMT was facing financial difficulties after its bank accounts were frozen by the Executive Yuan???s Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.???The incident goes to show our [close] relationship. We have talked about the 2020 race before, but Gou should be the one answering the question??? about whether he wants to represent the KMT in the next presidential election, Chan said.Gou???s mother loaned the KMT NT$45 million (US$1.49 million) in October last year when the party was struggling to pay its employees.Gou last week attracted public attention after he was filmed walking out of the White House on Thursday and Friday during a trip to Washington to discuss a potential investment in the US.The White House yesterday confirmed that Gou on Friday briefly met with US President Donald Trump.Chan said the KMT should engage in self-reflection and explore ways to attract talent from various sectors of society to join the party.The party should propose policies that would touch the voters, instead of capitalizing on Gou???s influence, he added.However, the Facebook post was edited hours later to remove the parts about Chan asking Gou for a loan and Hau capitalizing on the businessman.Hau yesterday again pointed at Gou as the only person that stands a chance of defeating President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) in the next presidential election.???A party leader should be selfless and think about nothing but ???winning.???

Chang said.The government???s failure to allocate sufficient funds to official development assistance was a major obstacle to the nation???s efforts to convince other governments to support Taiwan in the WHO, he said.???We cannot attend the meetings empty-handed. Instead, we should have a compelling and professionally crafted cooperative strategy prepared after observing the needs of other nations and forming ties with their professionals,???

The DGH divided construction into three projects that were put up for tender.The first two, which involve building connecting roads at both sides of the bridge, were begun in October 2014 and January last year.However, the tender process for the construction of the main part of the bridge has failed three times, the DGH said.To facilitate the bidding process, the highway authority said that it is planning to raise the construction funds for the third project from NT$8.4 billion to NT$9.4 billion in the hopes of attracting qualified bidders at a tender session scheduled for May 23.The completion of the bridge would be set back until 2021 at the earliest, it said.The bridge, which is to be designed by London-based Zaha Hadid Architects, would be the world???s longest asymmetric cable-stayed bridge with a single pylon.Apart from car lanes, the highway authority said that it is to allocate space on the bridge for a light-rail system connecting New Taipei City???s Tamsui (?¡P??¢X?) and Bali (??????) districts.The Tamkang Bridge would help shorten the travel distance for people traveling between Tamsui and Bali by about 15km, shaving 25 minutes off their travel times.Travelers between the two  areas must now cross Guandu Bridge (????????¡±???) in Taipei???s Beitou District (??????).",1

Pomeroy said. ???These cities will start to play a bigger and bigger role in the world economy, and understanding what is going on there will be even more important.???That means policymakers will have to balance the upsides of urbanization ??? economies of scale, better productivity and infrastructure, chance encounters that lead to new ideas, better productivity and infrastructure ??? with the potential downsides, in the shape of increased crime, pollution and perpetually snarled traffic.If that does not happen, these ill effects could sap economic potential, Pomeroy said.The urban areas experiencing the biggest increase in population will probably be in Africa.Kigali, Rwanda???s capital, is expected to see its population of 1.3 million double in the next 15 years.To help prepare for that the city has developed a master plan for transportation and housing, with the aim of being a slum-free city.By 2030, 81 of the world???s 100 most populous cities are to be in emerging markets.",1

There is no doubt the local real food movement is a mega-trend,??? said Tobias Peggs, one of the co-founders, a 45-year-old from Britain who previously worked in software.???If you are 20 today, food is bigger than the Internet was 20 years ago when we got on it,??? he said. ???Consumers want trust, they want to know their farmers.???He set up Square Roots with Kimbal Musk, brother of Tesla Inc chief executive officer Elon Musk, and they have been training 10 recruits since November last year.Already well-established in parts of Europe ??? the Netherlands in particular ??? the technology is still being pioneered in the US.The greens are reared in an entirely closed and artificial environment that can be completely controlled, grown vertically and irrigated by a hydroponic system that feeds them water mixed with minerals and nutrients.Wylie Goodman, a graduate student finishing a dissertation on urban farming at Cornell University, said New York was a captive market for the innovations.???It makes total sense,??? she said. ???You???ve got a well-educated and wealthy population willing to pay a lot for good local food??? ??? in this case US$7 per single pack of fresh greens delivered to your door.New York and its environs have seen constant innovation in urban agriculture from rooftop gardens to the huge AeroFarm complex in neighboring Newark and Gotham Greens, which grows greens and herbs in ultra-modern rooftop greenhouses that can be harvested before breakfast and on a New York plate for lunch.Halfway through his year-long apprenticeship, Peggs said the 10 young entrepreneurs have already learned how to grow food customers want to buy.The next stage will begin within a year, he said, with the creation of ???campuses??? capable of producing greens ??? similar to the one in Brooklyn ??? in other large US cities before the initiative rolls out ???everywhere.???His enthusiasm is contagious. About 100 people who took part in a guided tour of the farm this week were for the most part not only willing to shop the greens but also appeared to be mulling over setting up something similar.However, there are downsides to the business model.If indoor farms can be adapted to grow strawberries and blueberries, ???no one with a background in agriculture??? thinks they would replace traditional, soil-based farms, Goodman said.In addition, products with a denser biomass, such as cereals or beets, are out of reach for the moment.???If I grew beets, I would have to sell it for US$50 a head,??? Peggs said.The working conditions are also an issue.???Do you really want to work in an enclosed, glowing environment???? Goodman asked.Besides, the lighting is too expensive and cultivation spaces at reasonable cost too few, at least for now.",1

Zhou wrote in a note. ???On the other hand, the deleveraging effort by the Chinese authorities, has started to work.???The employment sub-index slipped to 49.2 from 50 in March while the raw materials inventories sub-index was unchanged at 48.3.Growth in China???s services sector slowed slightly to 54 last month, compared with the previous month???s reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014.China???s economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and the nation???s gravity-defying property boom.However, growth is expected to slow as authorities step up a battle to cool the property sector, and as the central bank and banking regulator take steps to contain financial risks.Some analysts say China???s economic growth might have peaked in the first quarter, but that it is on track to hit a target of about 6.5 percent this year.China???s producer price inflation in March cooled for the first time in seven months as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter, despite robust property investment.The private sector Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, is to be published tomorrow.The Caixin/Markit PMI is expected to come in at 51 for last month, according to a Reuters poll of economists, down from 51.2 in March.",1

Oxfam spokeswoman Manon Aubry told reporters.???When the world???s most powerful country decides to slash tax revenues as much as this, a number of other countries may follow suit, bringing with it imbalances that will have enormous impacts on our societies,??? she said.Falling tax revenues would make it harder for governments to pay for welfare, healthcare and other benefits without going too deep into the red, she said.To make up the shortfall, governments could be tempted to hike valued-added tax, often criticized for placing a disproportionate tax burden on the less well-off, Aubry said.???The cut in corporate taxes in the US will fuel tensions between countries,??? said Jean-Pierre Lieb, a tax lawyer at consultants EY.Corporate taxes in the US are the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, followed by France with a rate of 34 percent, Belgium with 33 percent and Australia with 30 percent. The OECD average is about 24 percent.However, to become more attractive, a number of countries have decided to lower their corporate tax rates.Britain is planning to cut its rate from 20 percent to 17 percent in 2020, a decision that predates Trump???s move and was strongly prompted by fears that corporations might find the UK less attractive place after it leaves the EU.There were even plans to cut the rate to 15 percent to help with Brexit woes, British papers have reported, but British Prime Minister Theresa May appears to have ruled out such a deep cut for now.France, meanwhile, is poised to take its corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 28 percent in 2020.Other countries, including Italy and Israel, have similar ambitions.???What we???re seeing is a headlong rush??? said Lieb, pointing to the case of Hungary where the corporate tax rate is to be slashed from 19 percent to just 9 percent.However, even if Trump succeeds in pushing through his planned cuts, countries such as Ireland, which have used their low tax rates to woo foreign companies like Google and Apple Inc, still expect to remain attractive.",1

While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2
87,Editorials,"In February, former Executive Yuan director-general of personnel administration Chen Keng-chin (?????????) called on civil servants to ???milk their jobs??? and ???goof around??? as much as possible to drag down the government, but the nation???s chief executive, who should be the one most deeply insulted by Chen???s remark, said nothing.Protesters opposing pension reforms, who call themselves ???heroes,??? have been turning to violence and seem determined to take the nation down with them if their demands are not met, yet when police officers responsible for maintaining public order saw some of their retired former seniors among the rioters, they stood to attention and saluted.All the government???s talk of harshly punishing those who use violence is useless if the authorities appear so weak.In November last year, a group of retired generals went on a friendly visit to an enemy nation, where they sat and listened to instructions from that nation???s head of state and stood in respect for its national anthem ??? common sense and the Ministry of Defense???s own definition will tell you which enemy country we are talking about.Yet the commander-in-chief of Taiwan???s armed forces, who, again, should be the one most deeply insulted, had nothing to say.Living in today???s Taiwan, one often gets the feeling that important elements of the nation have gotten out of control, and it is hard to tell whether anyone is actually in charge.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???), who was elected by a majority, seems to be growing more and more distant from the public. Sadly, the public???s impression of her is that whenever she makes a speech, be it on a big or small occasion and no matter whether her speech is long or short, she is always clutching a script from which she reads every word without ever raising her eyes.When the speaker is uninspiring, the listener is uninspired. Tsai no longer shows any sign of her lively and friendly side, or of her wisdom as a prominent intellectual.National leaders??? success might stem from their verbal skill, their charisma, their good governance or their closeness to the public. How can Tsai put this nation back on its feet, establish democratic discipline and foster decent public behavior? I humbly and sincerely offer the following suggestions:First, the president should climb out of her ivory tower, meet people face to face and engage in frank and honest dialogue with her constituents.Second, she should greatly reduce the amount of ???state secrets.??? The more secrets there are, the more doubtful and suspicious the public will be. Most ???secrets??? are really unnecessary and only serve to satisfy the sense of superiority of a handful of people who have a monopoly on the information.The government should not just let the public know how things are, but also why things are the way they are. For example, what would be the harm in calling China ???China??? and Taiwan ???Taiwan????What harm would it do if the legislature passed a normal referendum law like those of other democratic nations? What harm would come from freezing or abolishing the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Taiwan Provincial Government? What negative impact could answering these questions possibly have on ???national security????Third, Taiwan could set a trend by doing something even advanced democracies have not done. Tsai could expand on the examples of former US presidents Franklin Roosevelt???s ???fireside chats??? and Ronald Reagan???s weekly presidential broadcasts by having national TV and radio stations set aside an hour every Sunday for a dialogue between the president and the public.",1
88,Editorials,"Two important bills have passed their third readings in the legislature. One was an amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act (????????????), passed on April 20, and the other was an amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act (?????¢F???????????????), which was passed on Tuesday. These two amendments have the same purpose: to secure financing for Taiwan???s long-term care services.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has exerted a great deal of effort in pushing the amendments and those aged 60 and older are certain to feel the benefits. However, looking at what kind of policies should be made a priority in terms of national development, this is policy for older people and it is less urgent than coming up with policies for the young.The two amendments originated with changes to the Long-Term Care Services Act (??¡P?????¡±??¡±?????????) passed last year, according to which long-term care should be financed by the tobacco, estate and gift taxes.The amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act adds NT$20 (US$0.66) to the tax on every pack of cigarettes, which will now total NT$31.8 per pack. According to the government???s calculations, this will contribute NT$23.346 billion to long-term care every year.The amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act changes the tax rate from a flat 10 percent to a three-tiered incremental tax of 10, 15 and 20 percent. The government estimates that this would contribute NT$6.3 billion to long-term care per year.Two legislative sessions have passed since the DPP government took office and since these are the bills it has focused on, it is clear that they constitute its main policy focus.The increase in the tobacco tax is aimed at public health issues such as tobacco hazard prevention, something most people can agree with.However, the estate and gift tax adjustments set off a wave of calls to reduce taxes, after the government???s policy direction became clear last year. The calls have extended to calls for adjustment to the taxes on cash, shares, real estate and insurance.Since neither Singapore nor Hong Kong or the rest of China have an estate tax, there have even been examples of wealthy people voting with their feet to protect their property. Experience bears this out: After the estate tax was cut to 10 percent in 2009, the government???s fiscal revenue remained about the same as it was before the amendment, when the tax stood at 50 percent.In other words, this source of fiscal revenue is unstable and it is questionable if the Ministry of Finance???s estimates will be met. It will be necessary to pay attention to the effect this will have on capital.However, these issues are not the point of this editorial. Considering Taiwan???s problems, more attention should be given to policies aimed at the young instead of focusing on the elderly. At the very least, the two groups should be given the same weight.If priority is given to policies for the elderly, that could remove all room for policies for young people. That would be a great mistake.The danger posed to Taiwan by a falling birth rate and an aging population is common knowledge. Let us leave aside immigration policies for the moment and focus on these two issues alone.We cannot stop people from growing old or reduce the number of elderly people, so if we are to change the demographic structure, there is only one way to go: encouraging families to have children.",1
89,Editorials,"The nation???s economic achievements were once internationally renowned, but economic growth has widened the ever-expanding gap between rich and poor.The lack of a bicameral legislature, of effective supervision of the executive offices and of government oversight in balanced regional development has caused cities that once flourished economically to decline in administrative functionality simply because of their distance from the capital.As young people migrate to Taipei with the promise of higher salaries, other cities continue to become more marginalized.Take Pingtung for example: the nation???s southernmost city, which has seen a population reduction of 46,930 people since 2010. The political and economic center of Taipei has been unconcerned with the city at the island???s southern tip since the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) moved to Taiwan from China.Pingtung has received proportionally far fewer national resources than other large cities. Many people in the city are concerned that it is becoming increasingly lethargic and that they might soon lose a legislative representative, which would reduce the say of Pingtung???s people in the Legislative Yuan.In the absence of ???economic human rights??? and protection from the federal government under the constitutional system, the decline of Pingtung epitomizes the nation???s economic development.It is unfortunate that this phenomenon has failed to garner the attention of the media, which are mostly located in Taipei, making Pingtung???s unbalanced development even more invisible to officials in the capital.A group has filed a petition through the government petition platform for the high-speed railway to be extended to Pingtung (https://goo.gl/34qnUM).The petition as of yesterday had been signed by 6,055 people, reaching the platform???s threshold within a week, whereas typically only about 4.7 percent of petitions are able to meet the requirements.The strong voice of these people has gathered great interest and attention from Taiwanese. The Pingtung County commissioner, as well as several social activism groups, have echoed the petition???s call to raise awareness about the importance of communication construction in Pingtung.Pingtung residents have come together on this issue, hoping for more balanced regional development and equality in economic rights. They believe that the government???s investment in communication infrastructure would be an important symbol of the government???s willingness to improve regional imbalance and economic inequality.For decades, Taipei has been the prime subject of consideration for resources and government policies. It does not favor local industrial transformation and innovation when talent and resources are concentrated in metropolitan regions.As most corporate headquarters and funds are concentrated in Taipei, other regions are forced to face population loss, lack of funding for infrastructure and fewer employment opportunities.As the economies in these regions continue to suffer, the gap between rich and poor continues to increase. Such hardships would undoubtedly become long-term challenges for rural regions.It is therefore all the more critical to come up with strategies to face these challenges, to eliminate domestic inequality and opposition, and to form alliances with other nations on the basis of the common goal of attaining regional balance and equal opportunity for all.",1
90,Editorials,"At a time when South Korea is struggling to deter North Korea???s nuclear threats, human rights advocates say its military is targeting gay soldiers in its ranks.In recent weeks, the army has focused on dozens of those soldiers in what rights groups say is a campaign against gay men in the 620,000-member military.At least 32 have faced criminal charges of ???sodomy or other disgraceful conduct,??? according to the domestic news media and lawyers and rights advocates familiar with the cases.On Tuesday night, the issue of gay rights became a focus in South Korea???s presidential race, when the candidate who leads in the polls, Moon Jae-in, joined some of the other contenders in saying that he opposed homosexuality.Critics said the statement was a tactic to win support among conservative voters.Moon made the comment during a debate in which the issue of the military???s treatment of gays was raised. Under the conscript system, all eligible men are required to serve about two years.However, the Military Criminal Act outlaws sodomy and other unspecified ???disgraceful conduct??? between servicemen, whether or not there is mutual consent and whether or not that conduct takes place on military compounds. Those found to have violated the act face up to two years in prison.The army declined to provide details on its investigation.However, it said that it was not cracking down on gay soldiers; instead it said that it was trying to root out sodomy and other homosexual activities, which right-wing Christian groups have called a growing blight on its readiness to fight North Korea???s 1.2 million-member military.However, in the past week, evidence has emerged to support the allegations by gay soldiers that investigators flouted the army???s own regulations on how to treat gay service members by preying upon the soldiers??? fear of shame and abuse if they are outed in the military.Analysts and veterans said bullying, hazing and sexual violence were chronic problems in the South Korean army.In a series of telephone conversations secretly recorded in March and last month, an army investigator warned a gay sergeant against seeking help from lawyers or the National Human Rights Commission of Korea.In one conversation, the investigator complained that another gay soldier refused to cooperate with the inquiry and wanted to hire a lawyer.???If he hires a lawyer, that means he is outing himself,??? the investigator says in the recording, uploaded to the Web site of the Seoul-based Military Human Rights Center for Korea.It is unknown how many gay soldiers were punished under the anti-sodomy law before the recent flurry of charges.Gay soldiers said they feared that they were being scapegoated in the recent inquiry as part of an effort by the army to contain sexual abuse.In a survey of 671 veterans commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission in 2004, more than 15 percent said they had been sexually abused.Advocates say that by punishing gay soldiers, the government was sending the wrong message in South Korea, where the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are a largely taboo and politically unpopular subject. Powerful right-wing Christian groups have intensified a campaign against homosexuality, scuttling a bill that would have given sexual minorities the same protection as other minorities.",1
91,Editorials,"North Korea observers have long marveled at the ability of a small, impoverished, autocratic nation to go toe-to-toe with the world???s superpowers.Part of the secret to North Korea???s success has always been the ruling Kim family???s mastery of the art of brinkmanship.What looks to outsiders like bluster, bombast and recklessness is actually a proven technique that over the years has won North Korea grudging respect from Washington and its allies, and has at times filled its coffers with aid offered by rivals relieved to see animosity on the Korean Peninsula ease.However, the roles might have reversed, with a new administration in Washington bulldozing its way to the brink before finally backing away.Korean war jitters made global headlines after US President Donald Trump issued repeated, ambiguous warnings about his willingness to take unilateral action and sent US military vessels to Korean waters.However, last week, Trump announced a much softer policy that combines diplomacy and economic sanctions and is strikingly similar to what frustrated past US presidents embraced.North Korea used to employ a comparable method: forcing the world to pay attention by staging nuclear and missile tests, issuing outrageous threats and occasionally lashing out with violence ??? and then offering negotiations.For decades, the tiny, Third-World dictatorship sandwiched between rich behemoths played the game remarkably well.However, some now see North Korea entering a frightening new phase, barreling across what were once considered ???red lines??? in a dash to build nuclear-armed missiles that can reach the US mainland.Here is a brief examination of North Korea???s mastery of brinkmanship and what might be coming next:US BRINKMANSHIP?Brinkmanship can be defined as the technique of pushing a dangerous policy to the edge of safety before stopping.Some Korea experts, analyzing what happened in recent weeks on the Korean Peninsula, believe that this time Washington engineered the brinkmanship.Presumably worried that North Korea would soon conduct its sixth nuclear test, the Trump administration threatened a possible attack, ordered a supercarrier and nuclear-powered submarine to Korea and linked the US bombing of Syria to North Korea.???They were putting the idea of a surprise military action out there, which is the definition of a dangerous policy on the Korean Peninsula,??? John Delury, an Asia expert and professor at Seoul???s Yonsei University, said of the US moves.Trump seemed to think he could pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons and, if that failed, would then consider a pre-emptive strike, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul???s Dongguk University.North Korea, for its part, was relatively restrained, analysts said.Yes, North Korea expressed anger, as it does every year, over annual springtime joint military exercises by Seoul and Washington that the North calls preparations for an invasion.However, its response did not go beyond what happens most years. That included bellicose threats, a [failed] missile test linked to the celebration of the birthday of North Korea???s founder Kim Il-sung and war games during the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People???s Army.NUCLEAR AND MISSILE TESTSA big part of North Korea???s past brinkmanship has always involved its weapons program.

It has helped me a great deal that I can occasionally just go galloping into the woods with my friends. It somehow balances my mind.???Like a real horse and its rider, the hobbyhorse and its master form a team and become attached to each other. Similarly, the sports simulates traditional equestrian events including competing in dressage and show jumping, and is physically demanding.Some actual horse riders may look down on hobby-horsing as childlike past-time not suitable for anyone aged over 10, but Equestrian Federation of Finland secretary-general Fred Sundwall disagrees.???We think it???s simply wonderful that hobby-horsing has become a phenomenon and so popular,??? Sundwall said. ???It gives a chance to those children and teens who don???t own horses to interact with them also outside stables and riding schools.???The vast majority of the hobbyhorses are homemade ???splendid, colorful creatures complete with names like Chattanooga Choo Choo and Panda ??? exchanged and sold by owners at events and through social media. Some of them have been known to fetch up to 200 euros (US$218 dollars) at auctions.Aficionados take high pride in the sport???s do-it-yourself attitude and very few industrially made hobbyhorses are seen at events because they are ???lower-caste horses,??? said Venla-Maria Uutela, a spokeswoman for a registered informal hobbyhorse society in Helsinki.About 10,000 people, nearly all of them between the ages of 10 and 18, are estimated to be involved in hobby-horsing in Finland. Its popularity is also growing steadily in the other Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe, though the numbers are much smaller.Regional competition events are arranged and organized by volunteers throughout Finland, culminating in national championships every year.This year???s main event took place late this month at a packed sports hall in Helsinki, attracting an estimated 1,000 spectators to watch about 200 participants competing with their hobbyhorses in several subcategories.???It???s very bizarre for other people to see, for the first time especially, this kind of stuff,??? said Taija Turkki, an 18-year-old hobbyhorse coach. ???Because they think we think the horse is alive, which we do not. We understand that it???s dead, made of fabric and all that.???Lack of strict rules and pompous ceremonies, strong social media presence and female bonding are a big part of the attraction.???Freedom to create and imagination are key aspects into why people start hobby-horsing,??? said Aarniomaki, a hobbyhorse veteran who does not compete actively anymore, but is keen on organizing related events such as a recent hobbyhorse parade through the streets of Helsinki.",1

97,Sports,"It never happened in the decade when the prosaic nature of his heavyweight domination quite underwhelmed boxing, but, at the age of 41, Wladimir Klitschko on Saturday belatedly earned proper appreciation for his greatness.How ironic, though, that it had to come in defeat.The veteran Ukrainian warrior came agonizingly close to becoming only the second fighter after George Foreman to win a recognized version of the world title as a forty-something before being stopped by Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium in London.Bruised, battered and with a deep cut by his left eye, he could only reflect ruefully on having failed to follow up his sixth round knock-down of Joshua aggressively enough, feeling he had let the Briton off the hook.Yet, although a 14-year age gap and Joshua???s fitness, strength and power eventually saw him floored twice and finally rescued by the referee in the 11th round, Klitschko still felt like a winner at the end of an exhilarating evening.Ninety thousand fans at Wembley seemed to agree as the man who was so often damned with faint praise during 11 years of heavyweight dominance received much greater acclaim here than he had after many of his mundane victories.Often portrayed as being too safety-first and mechanical in approach, here was a very different ???Dr Steelhammer,??? stung into desperate defiance after Joshua had sent him crashing to his knees with a fifth-round assault.It looked for all money like the end for the man who had appeared well past his sell-by-date in a sorry dethroning at the hands of Tyson Fury some 17 months earlier, but as Klitschko himself said: ???I took a beating, but I recovered well.???Indeed, in what was perhaps the most courageous couple of minutes in his two-decade professional career, Klitschko fought back dazzlingly, one big left hook setting up a counter-attack so ferocious that by the end of the round it was Joshua who was looking almost out on his feet.After following up with a booming right cross in the next which saw Joshua felled for the first time in his professional career, Klitschko made what he felt was a crucial, fight-turning error.???I thought he wouldn???t get up. Big respect to AJ. From that moment, I think I should have done more straight after he went down,??? he said. ???But I was pretty sure it was going to be my night so I took my time.???Big mistake. Joshua was given a breather and when he clawed his way back in the later stages, finding a ???second wind,??? his wicked body shots began to sap Klitschko???s stamina, setting up the painful denouement.As the Wembley crowd cheered him afterward, though, Klitschko started to appreciate that the historic contest had elevated the reputations of all involved.???I think Joshua and I both did great, I think we did a lot for the sport in the way we performed and how we respected and treated each other,??? he said. ???It was a great night for boxing and the fans. You will probably be surprised by my statement, but I don???t feel like I lost.??????Tonight, we all won. I didn???t get the belts but I didn???t feel like I lost ??? not my name, my face, nor my reputation. It was great to be involved in such an amazing occasion,??? Klitschko said.This did not sound like a man who was quite ready to hang up his gloves and he had not looked like one either as he often outboxed his old sparring partner, teaching Joshua more in one night than he had learned in his other 18 bouts combined.",1

For that he received the Piolet d???Or ??? considered the Oscar of mountaineering ??? the following year.In 2015, Steck decided to climb all 82 peaks in the Swiss Alps higher than 4,000 meters traveling between mountains by foot, bike and paraglider only.He completed the feat in 62 days, helping cement his reputation as the ???Swiss Machine.???Steck said in an interview last month with Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger that he considered himself an ???outsider??? in the mountaineering scene because athletic achievement is more important to him than adventure.Asked about his upcoming Everest-Lhotse expedition, involving a quick climb from one peak to the other including an overnight in the death zone, Steck said: ???When I???m on Everest I can stop at any point. The risk is therefore quite small. For me it???s primarily a physical project. Either I get through, or I don???t have the strength for the whole traversal.???Asked what he would consider to be success on his expedition, Steck told Tages-Anzeiger: ???Of course I want to climb Everest and Lhotse, but that???s a very high goal. Failure for me would be to die and not come home.???",1
99,Sports,"Before Game 2 against the Ottawa Senators, New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist spoke of his ability to reset after a narrow defeat in the series opener.???You try not to change anything,??? he said. ???You have your routine, the things you need to do going into every game. It doesn???t matter if you???re up one game or down one game.???What followed on Saturday at Canadian Tire Centre was anything but routine.Clearly nowhere near his laser-sharp best ??? acrobatically exhibited in a 2-1 loss to the Senators in Game 1 and in the opening round against Montreal ??? Lundqvist could not stop Jean-Gabriel Pageau, Ottawa???s unlikely hero.Pageau scored twice in the final four minutes of regulation to bring the Senators back from a two-goal deficit and capped the 6-5 comeback in the second overtime with his fourth goal of the game.???We played a strong game; we just came up a little bit short,??? a somber Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said.Ottawa has a two-games-to-none lead in this second-round series.Game 3 is played tomorrow in New York.Lundqvist and his teammates appeared to be headed for a series-tying win before Pageau ??? who scored only 12 goals in the regular season ??? notched his second goal of the game at 16 minutes, 41 seconds of the third period, then finished his hat trick at 18 minutes 58 seconds when Senators goalie Craig Anderson was pulled for an extra attacker.In the first overtime, the Rangers had a golden opportunity to escape with a victory when Rick Nash took the puck from Anderson behind the net.Nash had a chance to put it in, but it was poked away by Senators forward Kyle Turris.Nash???s squandered chance came after a stunning reversal in a third period that began with the Rangers seemingly assured of heading back to Madison Square Garden with the series tied at a game apiece.A strong second period had yielded three Rangers goals and a 4-2 lead, the kind that Lundqvist has been more than capable of defending.Michael Grabner opened the scoring for the Rangers with a short-handed goal at 4 minutes 16 seconds of the first, and Pageau tied the score with an unassisted goal at 13 minutes 59 seconds.The Rangers dominated the second period.Anderson had to make a flurry of early saves, stopping a frustrated J.T. Miller from close range with a virtual open net behind him.Miller, who has one assist and no goals in the playoffs, smacked his stick against the glass after he was denied.However, Chris Kreider ??? who made his Rangers debut during the 2012 first-round series against the Senators and also had been quiet in the playoffs ??? put his team ahead at 10 minutes 39 seconds off assists from Mika Zibanejad and Ryan McDonagh.Kreider shouted in delight as he celebrated his breakthrough moment along the boards.When he settled on the Rangers??? bench, Zibanejad, a former Senator, hugged him and planted a kiss on Kreider???s white helmet.Penguins 6, Capitals 2AP, WashingtonPhil Kessel scored twice, Sidney Crosby set up more goals and the Pittsburgh Penguins chased Braden Holtby on the way to a 6-2 victory over Washington Capitals in Game 2 that gave them a commanding 2-0 lead in their second-round series.Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 34 of the 36 shots he faced for Pittsburgh, which also got goals by Matt Cullen, Jake Guentzel and Evgeni Malkin.The Penguins scored three goals on 14 shots on Holtby, who was pulled in favor of Philipp Grubauer after the second period.",1

102,World News,"British Prime Minister Theresa May yesterday said that divorce talks with the EU would be difficult, responding to the tough stance taken by EU leaders over the upcoming Brexit negotiations.EU leaders on Saturday endorsed stiff divorce terms for Britain and warned Britons to have ???no illusions??? about swiftly securing a new relationship to keep their access to EU markets.???What this shows, and what some of the other comments we???ve seen coming from European leaders shows, is that there are going to times when these negotiations are going to be tough,??? May told the BBC.May also reaffirmed her position that she would be prepared to walk away from the talks on leaving the EU without a deal if she did not like what was on offer from Brussels.At the Brussels summit, which was marked by unusual harmony among the 27 leaders, there was a flash of the cross-Channel acrimony which some fear could wreck any deal when officials accused London of cynically vetoing some EU spending and demanded it back down or face disrupting the start of talks next month.Meeting for the first time since May triggered the two-year countdown to Brexit in late March, her counterparts took just minutes as they sat down to lunch in Brussels to approve eight pages of negotiating guidelines hammered out by their diplomats over the past month.They greeted the decision with applause, officials said.The text will bind Michel Barnier, their chief negotiator, to seek a deal that secures the rights of 3 million EU expatriates living in Britain, ensures London pays tens of billions of euros Brussels thinks it will be owed, and avoids destabilizing peace by creating a hard EU-UK border across the island of Ireland.???We are ready,??? Barnier said. ???We are together.???With Barnier expecting to launch negotiations after the June 8 election that May called to strengthen her position, the EU leaders also firmly ruled out discussing the free trade deal May wants until they see ???significant progress??? on key withdrawal terms.???Before discussing the future, we have to sort out our past,??? summit chair and European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters.He criticized British politicians ??? who have included May ??? for speaking of a quick deal to reassure expatriates when the legal complexities required much more detailed talks.???We need a serious British response,??? Tusk said.In London, Britain???s minister for leaving the EU said he wanted the negotiations to be conducted in a ???spirit of goodwill.??????But there is no doubt that these negotiations are the most complex the UK has faced in our lifetimes.

103,World News,"Thousands of people across the US on Saturday marched in rain, snow and sweltering heat to demand action on climate change ??? mass protests that coincided with US President Donald Trump???s 100th day in office and took aim at his agenda for rolling back environmental protections.At the marquee event, the People???s Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands of demonstrators made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue on their way to encircle the White House as temperatures soared into the 30s?C.Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco.A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city???s federal plaza to Trump Tower.???We are here because there is no Planet B,??? the Reverend Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told a rally in Boston.The demonstrations came one week after supporters of science gathered in 600 cities around the globe, alarmed by political and public rejection of established research on topics including climate change and the safety of vaccines.Participants on Saturday said they object to Trump???s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things.Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame.Among those attending the Chicago rally were members of the union representing US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees.Trump has proposed cutting the EPA???s budget by almost one-third, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs.American Federation of Government Employees Council 238 president John O???Grady called the march ???a chance to speak out in unity against this administration??? and its ???ridiculous gutting of the EPA budget and staffing.???More than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe.???I???ve seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,??? lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine, said.People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood.Saharlah Farah, a 16-year old immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could have a bigger toll on marginalized groups that have less financial resources.???But I see untapped power here today,??? she said.A demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Florida, where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city.",1
104,World News,"Faced with exploding populations and steadily rising temperatures worldwide, cities must make haste in reinforcing defenses against climate change-induced flooding and heat waves, experts said last week.City temperatures are forecast to shoot up in the coming years, exposing inhabitants to killer heat spikes, while rising sea levels and river flooding threaten homes, drinking water, and transport and electricity infrastructure.Cities are vulnerable to a unique risk called the ???urban heat island??? (UHI) effect ??? their concrete surfaces retain more of the sun???s heat than undeveloped areas, scientists said at a meeting in Vienna of the European Geosciences Union (EGU).By midcentury, if planet-warming fossil fuel emissions continue unabated, city temperatures in Belgium could exceed today???s heat-alert levels by as much as 10?C for 25 days each summer, according to one research paper.Another study showed that heat waves will become a frequent challenge for European cities ??? more numerous in the south of the continent, more intense in the north.Floods, a major risk to Europe???s dense urban settlements, will become more common because of an increase in freak rainstorms, as well as sea-level increases caused by polar ice melt and warmer ocean water expanding.In flood-prone Southeast Asia, precipitation is set to increase by 20 percent this century, one researcher said in Vienna.The stakes are especially high given the projections for expansion of urban areas, which are often ill equipped to deal with nature???s vengeance.Already, more than half the world???s population live in cities. By 2050, 80 percent of people in rich nations, and 60 percent in developing states, will be concentrated in built-up areas, according to recent calculations.This corresponds to the appearance of a settlement of 1 million inhabitants somewhere on the globe every week for the next 40 years.Occupying only a small portion of Earth???s available land, cities are responsible for 80 percent of all energy consumed and generate more than 60 percent of the planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted when humans burn fossil fuel for heating, power and transportation.In spite of efforts to curb emissions, the planet has already warmed about 1?C on average from pre-Industrial Revolution levels.Many scientists say the planet may be on track for 3?C of warming or more, exceeding the 2?C cap politicians set in Paris in 2015.This means cities must act now to shore up their defenses against impacts that can no longer be avoided, French climatologist Herve le Treut said at the annual EGU gathering.???It???s already happening,??? Le Treut said of climate change impacts. ???We have to start structural action quickly: transportation, houses... mainly in the cities, especially in vulnerable places.???Most of the infrastructure constructed by humanity is in urban zones.???The ways cities are built is not optimal??? for today???s climate reality, said Daniel Schertzer, a hydrometeorologist at the engineering school Ecole des Ponts ParisTech.???Historically, humans have settled near water, thinking of its usefulness, but not of the risk! Cities were conceived without taking geophysics into consideration, now they are discovering that nature is complicated, not just good,??? he said on the sidelines of the conference.Paris, for example, is due for its next so-called one-in-a hundred-year flood. The last major Paris flood, in 1910, saw the Seine river rise 8.62m, shutting down much of the City of Light???s basic infrastructure.",1
105,World News,"A multimillion-dollar program of events in Hong Kong is to mark 20 years since the territory was handed back to China by colonial ruler Britain, but critics say the show is out of step with political tensions.The large-scale celebrations come despite increased concerns over Beijing meddling in the territory and deep political divisions between Hong Kong???s pro-democracy and pro-China camps.Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) is expected to visit for the July 1 anniversary, with security exercises under way in preparation.Hundreds of events, from art exhibitions to sports tournaments, will take place between now and the end of the year as part of the festivities, with the government proposing to spend HK$640 million (US$82 million).Colored lights and rainbow posters already adorn local neighborhoods under the slogan ???Together, Progress, Opportunity.???An official video of Canto pop stars performing a new song, Hong Kong, Our Home, is frequently broadcast on television networks.Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying (?¢F???¡Â??¡Ó) said the celebrations reflected the territory???s ???vision of tomorrow,??? and aimed to engage all residents.???The handover to me is historically significant and worth commemorating because Hong Kong is originally a part of China,??? a 51-year-old resident who gave his name as Michael said.Retiree Ah Yu, 76, agreed, saying that the anniversary is ???important for Hong Kong because we are all Chinese.???However, others were skeptical.???Are we celebrating the fact that we don???t have freedom and have no democracy???? 67-year-old Ales Li said. ???Why don???t they use all these resources to mend divisions????Some young residents said they felt the celebrations were simply a stunt.???It isn???t really helpful towards anyone,??? university student Miranda Yeung, 20, said. ???It???s a great publicity campaign and it looks very exciting for a tourist, but it doesn???t really mean that much.???Others said the amount of money being spent was a waste in a territory with a yawning wealth gap.Frustration over a lack of political reform despite mass pro-democracy protests in 2014 has led to the emergence of groups demanding self-determination for Hong Kong or even a full split from China.That has sparked a backlash from Beijing, with Chinese authorities intervening to effectively bar two democratically elected pro-independence lawmakers from taking up their seats in last year.There are also concerns Beijing is interfering in other areas.Some believe a visit to the territory by Xi ??? his first since coming to power in 2012 ??? could be incendiary in the current climate.???The angry people will become more angry,??? Yeung said.Hong Kong???s next leader Carrie Lam (???????????¢D) ??? hated by pro-democracy activists ??? will also be sworn in on July 1. She has vowed to heal divisions, but critics say the festivities are unlikely to help.Art works from the Louvre, Egyptian mummies from the British Museum and an exhibition from Beijing???s Palace Museum will be on show as part of the celebrations.

109,Features,"Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, is launching a new online publication which will aim to fight fake news by pairing professional journalists with an army of volunteer community contributors.Wikitribune plans to pay for the reporters by raising money from a crowdfunding campaign.Wales intends to cover general issues, such as US and UK politics, through to specialist science and technology.Those who donate will become supporters, who in turn will have a say in which subjects and story threads the site focuses on. And Wales intends that the community of readers will fact-check and subedit published articles.Describing Wikitribune as ???news by the people and for the people,??? Wales said: ???This will be the first time that professional journalists and citizen journalists will work side-by-side as equals writing stories as they happen, editing them live as they develop, and at all times backed by a community checking and rechecking all facts.???Although the site is launching at the beginning of the UK general election campaign, Wales said the impetus for the project came from the US.???Someone I know convinced me to give Trump 100 days before making my mind up,??? he said, ???but then on day one Kellyanne Conway came out and said her ???alternative facts??? line. That was when I really decided to move forward.???If the fundraising campaign goes well, Wales hopes to be able to hire the site???s first journalists ???as soon as possible??? ??? perhaps before June 8, when Britons vote in the general election called by prime minister Theresa May.Like Wikipedia, Wales???s new project will be free to access.

Day; postponing the review until the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan report to the legislature on pension issues; that the government announce long-term reform plans to keep the pension funds afloat for at least 30 years; and for a constitutional interpretation to be sought on conflicting reform proposals.The DPP majority on the committee was able to reject the KMT motions.Saying that it did not oppose the reform, the KMT said the principle of legitimate expectation needed to be recognized.Some of the proposals might breach legitimate expectations, as civil servants ???decided to take government jobs under the presumption that they would be entitled to retirement benefits guaranteed by the existing system,???

115,Front Page,"US lawmakers yesterday unveiled a huge US$1 trillion-plus spending bill that would fund most government operations through September, but would deny US President Donald Trump money for a border wall and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs.The 1,665-page bill agreed to on Sunday is the product of weeks of negotiations. It was made public in the predawn hours yesterday and is tentatively scheduled for a House of Representatives vote tomorrow.The catchall spending bill would be the first major piece of bipartisan legislation to advance during Trump???s short tenure in the White House. While losing on funding for the wall along the US-Mexico border, Trump won a US$15 billion down payment on his request to strengthen the military, though that too fell short of what he requested.The measure funds the remainder of the current fiscal year, through Sept. 30, rejecting cuts to popular domestic programs targeted by Trump, such as medical research and infrastructure grants.Successful votes later this week would also clear away any remaining threat of a government shutdown ??? at least until the Oct. 1 start of the 2018 budget year.Trump has submitted a partial 2018 budget promising a US$54 billion, 10 percent increase for the Pentagon from current levels, financed by cutting to foreign aid and other nondefense programs by an equal amount.However, negotiators rejected a smaller US$18 billion package of cuts and instead slightly increased funding for domestic programs.Democrats were quick to praise the deal.???This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table,??? said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat and a key force in the talks. ???The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren???t used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle class relies on, like medical research, education and infrastructure.???However, some Republican conservatives were wary.???I think you???re going to see conservatives have some real concerns with this legislation,??? US Representative Jim Jordan said on CNN, citing domestic spending obtained by Democrats and other issues. ???We told [voters] we were going to do a short-term spending bill that was going to come due at the end of April so that we could fight on these very issues, and now it looks like we???re not going to do that.???The measure is assured of winning bipartisan support in votes this week; the House and Senate have until midnight on Friday to pass the measure to avert a government shutdown.Democrats played a strong hand in the talks since their votes are needed to pass the bill, even though Republicans control both the White House and Congress. As a result, the measure does not look much different than the deal that could have been struck on former US president Barack Obama???s watch.",1

Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lee (?????¡±???) said yesterday.Lee made the remark in response to a question by New Power Party Legislator Freddy Lim (?????????) at a meeting of the legislature???s Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee.The WHA is to meet in Geneva, Switzerland, from May 22 to 31.Taiwan first attended the WHA as an observer in 2009, a year after former president Ma Ying-jeou???s (?????¡Ó???) administration came to power, adopting a conciliatory policy toward Beijing.Since then, Taipei has sent a delegation to Geneva every year, but has not yet received an invitation to this month???s meeting.There are concerns that Beijing might try to block Taiwan???s participation to the WHA in light of strained cross-strait relations since President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) took office in May last year.Lim criticized the government for accepting an invitation to the assembly last year, because it included a reference to Beijing???s ???one China??? principle.???If China will not even allow us to attend the WHA, despite how much patience we have shown and how much we have swallowed our pride, then this goes to show that swallowing our pride does not win respect or goodwill,??? Lim said, calling on the government to consider pushing for a ???more normal and natural??? way of participating.The majority of Taiwanese do not understand why Beijing will not allow Taiwan to take part even as an observer in non-political organizations, such as the WHA, Lee said.If Beijing understood Taiwanese???s feelings, it would discard its old way of thinking and approach the issue with a new attitude, he said.The government has a backup plan in case it is not invited, Lee said, without providing details.The meeting???s main topic of discusion was the ???new framework??? for Taiwan-US relations approved by Tsai last month.The extensive vacancies related to East Asian Policy within the US executive branch is ???definitely a problem,??? Lee said, citing a member of a US-based think tank who said the US supports Taiwan???s participation in the WHA, but lacks officials to implement the policy.Numerous political appointments in the US Department of State, Department of Defense and Department of Commerce remain vacant several months into US President Donald Trump???s presidency, he said.???Right now we absolutely cannot find anyone who can hold talks with us,??? he said, adding that any talk of importing US pork or pushing for the ???new framework,??? aimed at increasing the frequency and level of official contact between Taiwan and the US, would have to wait until those vacancies are filled.",1

123,Taiwan News,"Despite securing her sixth badminton World Super Series title in Wuhan, China, on Sunday, Taiwanese player Tai Tzu-ying (?????????) yesterday said she did not enjoy the final game because she was struggling to play in an oversized shirt and ill-fitting pants.???I was not enjoying the game because I had to roll up the sleeves on my shirt. I also had a hard time adjusting the pants. It hurt my tummy if I tied my pants up too tight, but they would fall down if they were too loose,??? Tai wrote on Facebook.Tai said she was scheduled to leave for China on April 23, but she did not get her uniform until April 21, so she had little time to have the clothing adjusted.Even though Tai would have been given the shirt in the size she requested, she said the clothing is almost always either too big or too small because different sportswear manufacturers use different templates.She said she would sometimes ask for her uniform to be based on men???s clothing sizes, but the outfits would be made based on women???s sizes, which are too small for her.???You never know the kind of uniform you are going to get and you have to try on the shirts and the pants to see if they actually fit. I felt like I had no time to adjust the uniform. Players from other countries can wear the sports gear that they like when they compete in the Asian Championships, World Championships and the Olympics. Our players would likely feel more comfortable if they could do the same, rather than getting used to playing in a uniform that does not belong to them,??? she said.Tai said that she is scheduled to represent Taiwan in the Sudirman Cup later this month, which is a mixed team badminton championship.She said she is only asking for a uniform that fits, adding that all Taiwanese players should be allowed to wear clothing that fits well.This is not the first time Tai has had problems with her uniform for international games.The Chinese Taipei Badminton Association was criticized after last year???s Olympic Games in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, for threatening to fine Tai for not wearing the shoes provided by Yonex, the team???s official sponsor.The association congratulated Tai for being the first Taiwanese to win the Badminton Asia Championships title.It also said that it has asked the uniform sponsor to make customized outfits for Tai, adding that the sponsor should deliver the national team uniforms to athletes as soon as possible so that they have time to get used to or change their uniform.",1

Day released statistics from its working population health condition survey last year, which also suggested that 51.8 percent of workers do not get enough exercise.The survey showed that 54.9 percent of workers eat breakfast outside of the home more than five times a week on average, 61.5 percent eat lunch outside more than five times a week and only 19.2 percent consume the suggested daily amount of fruit and vegetables.HPA Community Health Division head Lin Li-ju (?????????) said that since employees spend about one-third of their work day at their place of employment ??? during which many people sit for long hours ??? combined with a lack of exercise and fruit and vegetable intake, people can easily become overweight.The agency encouraged employers to make an open commitment to promote healthier workplaces by setting up group health improvement goals, understanding employees??? health needs by reviewing their examination reports, setting up exercise groups, ordering healthier lunch boxes and unsweetened drinks and rewarding departments for improvement.Studies have shown that promoting a healthier workplace could have many benefits for employees and the company, including reducing resignation and sick leave rates and employees??? stress and work injuries, as well as increasing productivity, work quality and employee satisfaction, and improving corporate image, it said.Lin said employees could also adopt healthier daily habits, such as getting off the bus one stop early, climbing the stairs instead of taking the elevator, standing up and moving more, and eating a balanced diet with enough fiber.",1

One picogram is one trillionth of a gram.Dioxins, a group of highly toxic and potentially carcinogenic chemicals, are pollutants produced as a result of human activity, such as burning garbage, and can accumulate in the food chain, mainly in the fatty tissue of animals.Dioxins can damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and can cause cancer, reproductive and developmental problems, according to the WHO.On April 21, the FDA ordered eggs from three farms in Changhua County???s Fangyuan Township (??????) be removed from store shelves as a precautionary measure after excessive levels of dioxins were found in an egg from the area.After investigation, two of the three farms were cleared and Hung Chang farm was identified as the source of the problem.The owners of the other two farms are demanding government compensation for loss of revenue.",1

Taoyuan outlet, as the hotelier seeks to increase its share of the banquet business.The company posted revenue of NT$374 million (US$12.38 million) in the first quarter, representing a 4.6 percent year-on-year increase.???The scale increase would allow FDC to raise its revenue at a faster pace from this quarter,??? company chairman Emile Sheng (?????????) told a news conference.FDC was spun off from L???Hotel de Chine Group (LDC, ???????¡±????), which owns Palais de Chine, Maison de Chine, Chateau de Chine, Chinatrust Hotels (????????????) and five more outlets in Italy.Sheng declined to comment on the cost of the acquisition, saying only that FDC would pay 3 percent of its revenue to its unlisted parent company, LDC, the actual buyer of the Splendor restaurant.Profit margins for banquet businesses are twice as high as that for other restaurants, explaining why the group is growing its banquet business despite intensive competition, FDC president David Ding (?????????) said.After taking over the food and beverage operation of Chateau de Chine???s Taoyuan outlet, FDC is to rename it the Taoyuan Mingsheng branch of Gala de Chine (????????¡±?¢G¡Â???), the banquet arm of FDC.In three months??? time, the Splendor restaurant is to be renamed the New Taipei Beixin branch of Gala De Chine, allowing the 15-year-old restaurant and customers some time to get used to the change.Under the arrangement, Gala De Chine, previously the sole banquet outlet in New Taipei City???s Sinjhuang District (??¢X???), has grown into a restaurant chain that also includes seafood buffet restaurant Giardino (?????¡Ó???).The banquet business is less vulnerable to economic cycle volatility and fluctuations in the number of foreign travelers, Ding said.Banquet operators need only to increase temporary staff during the high season and cut headcount in the low season, Ding said, adding that FDC has rehired almost all the employees Splendor laid off on April 30.Sheng attributed Splendor???s sale to family disputes and said he welcomed peers in similar situations to join FDC or LDC.LDC plans to launch a new outlet in Italy and has inked a contract with a Taiwanese partner to open a new property under Maison de Chine, Sheng said, refusing to elaborate.",1

135,Business,"Chang Chieh-kuan (?????????), the owner of the last Chinese character letterpress and the last lead-character moldmaker in Taiwan, has long dreamed about passing on his work so that the dying technique of which he is a master practitioner can be preserved.However, just days before his humble shop, Rixing Type Foundry (??¢D????????????), squeezed into a small lane on Taipei???s Taiyuan Road (???????¡P¡Â), celebrated its 48th anniversary yesterday, 65-year-old Chang came to believe those hopes were a pipe dream and that it would be impossible to cultivate such talent.???I will just carve as long as I can,??? Chang said, as he strives to preserve the culture of Chinese letterpress printing against the passing of time and advent of new technology.Rixing Type Foundry is possibly home to the last remaining collection of traditional Chinese movable type character molds in the world. It possesses 120,000 molds of different characters in a wide range of sizes and three different typefaces ??? kai ti (?¢D¡P???) (regular script), song ti (??????) and hei ti (??????) (sans-serif black) ??? and has more than 10 million lead character pieces for printing or sale.The foundry also has several molding machines that allow it to fabricate 3D lead type pieces, making it the last and only foundry of its kind in Taiwan.However, the business might fade into history because many of its bronze molds are either partly or wholly worn.What makes the situation even more daunting, as Chang has long feared, is that there is no way to train anyone in the skills needed to repair bronze molds for lead type.It was in 1979 when Chang, a trained steel mechanic, started working at the lead foundry his father opened in 1969.Training in the crafting and mending of lead type bronze molds should really start at 12 or 13, because it takes 10 to 15 years to master the skills, he said.In addition, traditional masters remain at the peak of their abilities for about 10 years, at which point they have to rely more on experience as their eyesight deteriorates, Chang said.???These days it is impossible to acquire apprentices aged 12 or 13. If people come here after graduating from college or university, their eyesight is already not good enough to do the job,??? Chang said.Joking that he was ???forced??? to enter the business, the lead type foundry master said he now often spends most of the day at his desk, mending the worn molds.However, he said he never grows tired of the repetitive nature of tasks such as recrafting, scanning and correcting character types, which can seem extremely monotonous to an outsider. ???I do not know how long the bronze molds at Rixing will last, as many of them are already badly worn,??? Chang said. ???I am now 65 years old. It will take another 65 years to repair them all.???A skilled foundry master can mend a maximum of five character molds per day, he said, adding that to restore all 120,000 molds at Rixing Foundry would be extremely expensive.Despite the time-consuming and labor intensive nature of the work, Chang told visitors to his shop that lead type imbues Chinese characters with a grandeur that digital printing cannot replicate.It is like the difference between listening to music on vinyl or CD; it is all about the warm sentiment lead type conveys, he said.Early this year Rixing launched a type bronze mold restoration project in the hope that an online fundraising program would help raise the funds needed to preserve its endangered bronze molds so that they can be passed on in their entirety.",1
136,Business,"Taiwan???s notebook shipments in the first quarter rose 6.3 percent year-on-year, their first uptick since the final quarter of 2014, the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC, ??¢F?¢D??????¡Ó?????????) said on Friday.The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc???s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (??¡Ó??????) said.Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said.Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said.Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight  designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year???s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays.Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China.A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said.The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand.Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed.While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc???s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp???s Kraby Lake, the institute said.However, AMD???s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said.The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses.As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.",2

139,Business,"A state-owned Swedish company has become the latest European firm to enter Britain???s lucrative energy market, as the kingdom???s appeal to continental power suppliers shows no sign of abating after the Brexit vote.Vattenfall AB, which is 100 percent controlled by the Swedish government, is launching its first foray into British energy supply as it joins a competitive field of European players including  Electricite de France SA (EDF), German-owned E.ON SE, Npower Ltd and Spanish-backed ScottishPower Ltd.Vattenfall has already made inroads in Britain by building several wind farms, including a North Sea project near Aberdeen and Wales??? largest offshore wind farm which is due to complete next year.Now, in what Vattenfall has described as a vote of confidence in post-referendum Britain, the firm is to sell its renewable power from the wind farms direct to business customers.???Long term we don???t see that this [Brexit] as changing the basic prerequisite for doing business together. We find the UK to be an attractive market for us now and going forward, and we will continue to invest in the market,??? Vattenfall executive Anna Borg said.Vattenfall follows established European players such as EDF and E.ON, but also Danish state-owned Dong Energy A/S, which sells its wind power to corporate clients, and Dutch firm Eneco Holding NV, which supplies business customers such as Heineken NV and Unilever PLC.France???s Engie Group is also attempting to muscle in on the consumer market and trying to woo households with a tariff that tracks wholesale power prices.Borg said European power companies are attracted to the British market because of two fundamentals ??? tight margins between energy ??? and demand which means a constant appetite for new entrants and Britain???s legally enshrined climate targets, which are to remain when the kingdom leaves the EU and ensure demand for energy generated by renewables or nuclear.The combination, she said, means the government is supporting investment in new plants and requires energy from low-carbon entrants. Vattenfall believes its portfolio of renewable power and the confidence instilled by dealing with an established player would help it win over corporate customers wanting to burnish their green credentials.Borg said Vattenfall is a state-owned company which has been around for 100 years and is here to stay.Vattenfall???s decision to sell its German coal business last year to focus on green energy also showed it was capable of transforming, Borg added.While Vattenfall is not yet naming its first customers, it said it is in talks with British retailers, manufacturing industries and data center operators.Borg would not be drawn on whether the Swedish firm was considering making a play for the consumer market, which is dominated by six big energy suppliers, four of which are owned by European energy companies.???It???s too early to say.

140,Business,"Chinese investment in Australia surged 11.7 percent last year to A$15.4 billion (US$11.5 billion) amid booming demand for agricultural assets and infrastructure, according to a report released yesterday.A record 103 deals were signed with Chinese companies last year, with 76 percent of those reached with private firms, KPMG and the University of Sydney said in the report Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia.Australia, with a population of 24 million people and a land mass larger than India, relies on foreign investment to spur growth.While Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull???s government blocked two key purchases by Chinese companies last year, citing national security, the report shows that the vast majority of deals were approved.???There are signs of a growing maturity by Chinese investors in the Australian market,??? the report said in its key findings. ???The number of joint ventures is increasing with more repeat investments by established Chinese companies. This has set a foundation for growth in future investment.???Commercial real estate remained the largest sector, attracting 36 percent of Chinese investment, followed by infrastructure with a record 28 percent, including the purchases of Asciano Ltd and the Port of Melbourne, the report said.Agribusiness rose threefold from 2015 to more than A$1.2 billion.While Australia remained second only to the US as the biggest recipient of Chinese capital since 2007, the growth in investment was last year dwarfed by the increase of flows into the EU and Brazil.Turnbull???s government faces growing calls from fringe populist parties to restrict foreign deals and opinion polls show there is public unease about Chinese investment, particularly from state-run companies, in farmland and other key assets.Since 2007, Australia has attracted a total of US$90 billion in Chinese investment ??? second only to the US, the report found.",1
141,Business,"HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Group PLC???s Saudi Arabia ventures are exploring a potential merger to create the kingdom???s third-largest lender with US$78 billion in assets.Alawwal Bank, which is 40 percent owned by RBS, plans to start initial talks with HSBC???s Saudi British Bank (SABB), according to a statement on a Saudi stock exchange Web site.Both lenders are based in Riyadh, with HSBC owning 40 percent of SABB.The negotiations come as banks grapple with how to approach the Middle East???s biggest economy, which is embarking on an unprecedented diversification and privatization plan, but still blocks foreign control of local banks.The combined entity would be the kingdom???s biggest after National Commercial Bank and Al Rajhi Bank and follows the merger of other regional lenders as they battle with sustained low oil prices, slower economic growth and a decline in asset quality.???The current environment is ideal for mergers,??? Arqaam Capital Ltd equity research director Jaap Meijer said by telephone. ???Growth opportunities are limited, and banks need to cut costs to still deliver returns for shareholders.???The combination would also make it easier for RBS to exit Saudi Arabia ???as it will hold a smaller stake in a bigger, stronger bank.???SABB shares had by 10:41am yesterday climbed 6.2 percent on the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh trading, while Alawwal jumped 9.7 percent.RBS has for years tried unsuccessfully to sell its Alawwal holding, which is worth about US$1.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Any interest in the stake came from local or regional groups, according to analysts and people familiar with the transactions.Credit Agricole SA, which is also considering the sale of its 31 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi, has failed to attract big-name global banks, people familiar with the matter said.A deal would mark Saudi Arabia???s first banking industry merger for almost 20 years and could prompt other deals.Samba Financial Group merged with United Saudi Bank in 1999, creating one of the largest regional financial institutions at the time, of which Citigroup owned 23 percent, according to Samba???s Web site.Saudi Arabia is home to about 33 million people and 26 banks ??? 12 local and 14 foreign lenders.???The history of mergers in the country is checkered as a few have tried and been unsuccessful,??? Riyad Capital research director Muhammad Potrik said.If this deal is successful it ???could be a precursor to the start of a M&A; [mergers and acquisitions] trend in the banking and other sectors such as petrochemicals, insurance and retail,??? he said.Elsewhere in the Gulf Cooperation Council, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC and First Gulf Bank PJSC last month completed a merger to create the United Arab Emirates??? largest bank with assets of US$180 billion. Qatar???s Masraf Al Rayan QSC, Barwa Bank QSC and International Bank of Qatar QSC last year announced plans for a three-way mergerBoth Alawwal and SABB primarily lend to businesses, not consumers, and both reported that non-performing loans to the construction and building industry more than tripled last year.Lending by Saudi banks to the private sector was expanding rapidly as recently as last year, but has since stalled.

142,Business,"Mass-media company 21st Century Fox Inc is in talks with Blackstone Group LP, the giant investment firm, to make an offer for Tribune Media and its stable of TV stations, people briefed on the negotiations said on Sunday night, a move that would potentially forestall a rival bid for Tribune.The move by Fox and Blackstone is aimed at not only bolstering Fox???s TV portfolio, but also beating an offer by Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc, the US??? biggest station operator, before a bidding deadline this week.The people briefed on the talks spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations are continuing.Under the terms of the potential arrangement, Blackstone would contribute cash to the venture, while 21st Century Fox, the huge entertainment company run by the Murdoch family, would contribute its 28 owned-and-operated stations.Representatives of 21st Century Fox and Blackstone declined to comment on their talks, which were reported earlier by Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.Tribune, which was formed when its parent company divided its TV and its print media holdings into two separate companies, owns 42 stations ??? and has the most Fox affiliates of any station owner. As of Friday, the company???s market value was about US$3.2 billion.The surge of interest in Tribune comes after the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last week decided to change regulations governing station ownership.The FCC???s move to reinstate the so-called ultra-high-frequency (UHF) discount ??? backed by the agency???s two Republican commissioners and opposed by its sole Democratic one ??? essentially loosened rules limiting how many stations a single operator could own, though companies are still forbidden to cover more than 39 percent of US households.The discount allowed broadcasters to include only half of their stations broadcasting on UHF toward ownership limits.Bringing back the discount, analysts have said, all but guarantees new efforts at consolidating the TV industry even further.Broadcasters, including Tribune, praised the FCC???s decision as one that lets them become more competitive with rival service providers such as cable and satellite companies.???Today???s action by the Federal Communications Commission is a welcome step toward creating a more level playing field for all local broadcasters in their relationships with TV networks, satellite operators, cable providers, and streaming video services,??? Tribune said in a statement last week.The expected return of the UHF discount under US President Donald Trump???s administration was what led companies such as Sinclair, which has 173 stations, and Fox to weigh bids for Tribune. Other broadcasters are said to be considering takeover offers for Tribune as well.FCC chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, has hinted that he is open to further deregulation of TV station ownership.For Fox, blocking Sinclair???s bid for Tribune would eliminate the creation of a more formidable opponent when negotiations for broadcasting fees occur.Fox, embattled by sexual harassment scandals at its Fox News cable network, has been working to shore up its TV empire in other ways. It is waiting for British regulatory approval to buy full control of Sky, the British satellite TV giant in which it owns a 39 percent stake.Two weeks ago, that pursuit was delayed by the British communications regulator as it continues to review whether the combined company would be ???fit and proper??? to hold a broadcasting license.",1

Rudd said in an e-mailed statement. ???We will continue to push the internet companies to make sure they deliver on their commitments.???The committee???s inquiry was sparked by the murder of House of Commons lawmaker Jo Cox during the referendum campaign last year on leaving the EU.

The company removed many of them after the lawmakers complained, but it refused to delete a cartoon showing ???ethnic minority migrants tying up and abusing a semi-naked white woman, while stabbing her baby to death,??? because it did not breach its ???hateful conduct policy,??? the report said.Facebook had community pages ???devoted to stirring up hatred, particularly against Jews and Muslims,??? the panel said.The company removed some posts that the committee highlighted, but said the community pages were not violations.The report criticizes the companies for relying on others to report offensive material, ???outsourcing the vast bulk of their safeguarding responsibilities at zero expense.???It said that soccer teams are required to pay the costs of policing matches and urged the government to consult on whether Internet companies should have to pay the cost of policing their sites.???The major social media companies are big enough, rich enough and clever enough to sort this problem out ??? as they have proved they can do in relation to advertising or copyright,??? the report said. ???It is shameful that they have failed to use the same ingenuity to protect public safety and abide by the law as they have to protect their own income.???Facebook said it has ???quick and easy??? ways for users to report content and ???nothing is more important??? to the company than people???s safety.",1

The banking association calculates Sweden will have amassed 222 billion kronor (US$25.11 billion at current exchange rates) to deal with troubled lenders by 2032.That is 10 times more than it would have had if Sweden had used standard EU bank union rules.The Swedish government has said that it needs to create additional safeguards to protect taxpayers from a financial system that is about four times the size of the economy.If Nordea were to move to Denmark, the country???s regulator would be responsible for bank assets that would be more than five times the country???s GDP.

146,Editorials,"A media interview can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it gives politicians a chance to explain their views; on the other hand, it can sometimes backfire and have the opposite effect. President Tsai Ing-wen???s (?????¡Ó???) interview with Reuters on Thursday has turned out to be an example of the latter.This was not due to any mistake by Tsai; instead, it was Reuters??? doing. There was nothing inappropriate or wrong in Tsai???s responses to the reporters??? questions. Always cautious, Tsai gave appropriate and concrete answers to their questions. She was forthcoming and direct, and displayed the views and bearing becoming of a president.She was not overbearing on the issue of relations between Taiwan, the US and China, and she gave voice to a Taiwanese identity without deliberately fawning on either the US or China. In short, her behavior was presidential and praiseworthy.The problem was the reporters??? hypothetical line of questioning.For example, the reporters asked Tsai: ???Will you hold further conversations with [US] President [Donald] Trump? Are you expecting to???????We are of course hoping that we will have the opportunity to communicate directly with the US government at critical moments and on critical issues, and do not rule out the opportunity for another telephone conversation with President Trump himself, but this will be dependent on the overall situation and on the US government???s concerns when it comes to handling the affairs of this region,??? Tsai said.This is both a balanced and relevant answer.However, the headline Reuters gave the report was: ???Exclusive: Taiwan president says phone call with Trump can take place again,??? and a Reuters reporter immediately asked Trump if he would call Tsai again.Trump, unaware of the interview with Tsai, brushed the question aside and said that he was addressing the North Korea issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????), and that he did not want to irritate Beijing with any other issues.Trump???s response was reasonable: North Korea is the issue that the US most urgently needs to resolve and it needs China???s help to do so.Another question posed by Reuters was: ???Will you directly rule out purchasing F-35 jets???????Our military purchases will be directed by our defense strategy needs, and we don???t rule out any item that would be meaningful to our strategy. The F-35 is indeed one such item,??? Tsai said.A Reuters reporter directly asked Trump whether the US would sell F-35s to Taiwan, since Taiwan wants to buy them. Trump said that he had not been notified, that he needed to think about it and that he had to confer with his team.Reuters??? handling of the report gave the impression that Tsai had suggested that a second telephone conversation with Trump should be organized, and that Trump had rejected the suggestion. However, the Chinese transcript of the interview on the Presidential Office???s Web site shows that Tsai only responded to the Reuters reporter???s question by saying that it would depend on the US government???s considerations, and that there were currently no such plans on either side.The purchase of F-35 jets is also a hypothetical issue that lacks any substance.Reuters had a great opportunity to interview Tsai, and several important issues were discussed during the interview. Too bad that all the good points have been drowned out by the furor over two non-issues.",1
147,Editorials,"The world that we live in is far different from that which experienced the Cold War mentality and ideological struggles at the end of World War II. At that time, the Allied powers had defeated the Axis alliance, and a new struggle appeared between communism and democracy.Ironically, however, even as that ideological struggle emerged, it was itself being subtly questioned in George Orwell???s Animal Farm. One of the basic points that Orwell was making and which is often lost in the allegory is that at the end of the story, the other farm animals found it difficult to distinguish between their previous capitalist rulers and the pigs that replaced them.This insight is what makes Thomas Piketty???s Capital in the Twenty-First Century all the more intriguing and worth re-examining from at least two perspectives. First is how capitalism, which contains many destructive seeds of humanity, can span ideology, and second, the highly important and slowly realized attention that this places on the burgeoning democracy of Taiwan.Piketty???s main thesis treats the growing problem of wealth and income inequality, which he found in Europe and the US since the 18th century, and how it threatens democracy.What Piketty does not delve into are those countries allegedly fashioned by Marxist communism, where the same wealth gaps and disparity hold true as well. Age-old desires for power and control remain the sought-after ends and unchecked capitalism has quickly supported this by creating new oligarchies in Russia and China.These two nations, along with the US, are the top three countries with the largest number of billionaires. The families and princelings of oligarchs have replaced the families of the czars and emperors in Russia and China.On the US side, capitalism appears to be returning to the past days of the robber barons. In short, oligarchies are becoming the new bloodlines of inherited power and the new despotism; this is a point that fits Orwell???s allegory.Unfortunately, oligarchies and privilege are the same the world over. A different book by business journalist Duff McDonald, The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and its Secret Influence on American Business, shows how this firm has become the ???godfather of CEO megapay??? in a leading democracy.This contributed to the new phrase: ???We are the 99 percent.???The truth of this slogan is increasingly becoming real. One can argue with Piketty over the means of determining wage gaps, but one does not need to be a rocket scientist to see the disparity in a country where its Congress and state electors argue over a minimum wage of US$15 for average citizens while CEO pay has skyrocketed to 500 times that of ordinary workers. This is the new ???Animal Farm.???Who can tame the new pigs? Transparency and a free press are essential to this and often lacking even in the US where the growing consciousness of the meaning and implications of who the ???99 percent??? are is taking hold.Transparency, transparency, transparency. For US citizens, those who put their faith in the blustering and boasting promises of US President Donald Trump, history states that they are asking to be disillusioned. There is a weasel quality about a man who now even seeks to hide who visits him in the White House and who refuses to honor his promise to show his tax returns.",1

This violates the principle of love and non-violent protest, which means demonstrators can use their bodies to promote their demands and public interests, but not harm innocent people.While the rallies called for the supervision of reforms, they were entirely aimed at protecting the private interests of the protesters.On April 19, lawmakers yielded and agreed to hold two more public hearings, although public hearings and preparations for the national congress on pension reform have been under way for a full year.These people continue to cause social costs with the sole purpose of highlighting and prolonging the focus on their demands.Moreover, the actions of the so-called ???800 heroes??? looked as if they were rallying in support of a certain Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) chairperson candidate.Meanwhile, Chang An-lo (?????????) ??? or the ???White Wolf???

With every city and county demanding an MRT or light-rail system, Tainan, Hsinchu, Keelung and Changhua are next in line to join Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taoyuan and Taichung. This development is no different from the 1990s policy to open many new universities, which has resulted in a higher education crisis.People who have traveled on the Taipei MRT are surely impressed by its convenience and the crowds. It seems that having an MRT is the symbol of a fashionable city. Having experienced the ???convenience??? and seen the ???profits??? made by its operator, Taipei Rapid Transit Corp, city mayors and county commissioners across the nation want to emulate this success.However, the Taipei MRT???s 20-year history shows that although the average number of people using the system last year exceeded 2 million per day, the transportation side of the business was still losing money. Had it not been for other sources of revenue, such as advertising and rent, there would not have been enough money to cover the system???s operating costs.Taipei and New Taipei City have a population of more than 6.5 million, and combined with tourists and business visitors, these people account for the average daily transport volume of more than 2 million passengers.Kaohsiung has a population of less than 3 million, and after 10 years in operation, the transportation side of its MRT business is still losing money. Let us not even mention Changhua County, with a population of less than 1.3 million. If local populations continue to grow, it might make sense, but are not all Taiwanese feeling the pressure of the nation???s low birthrate?Those who want to use transportation infrastructure to bolster the local economy might have mistakenly simplified the relationship between cause and effect. Transportation infrastructure is indeed an important component of economic development, but it is not certain to create economic development. Other key components are an available workforce and a conducive industrial environment.Transportation infrastructure alone without supporting measures run the risk of resulting in an empty and unused MRT system.Yang Chih-yuan is an assistant professor at National Taiwan Normal University.Translated by Lin Lee-Kai",1

The company is targeting growth in the Asia-Pacific region, where regional head Sanjay Aurora is promoting Darktrace???s Enterprise Immune System at the CeBIT Australia conference in Sydney on May 23.In an interview ahead of the conference, Aurora told the Guardian that the Internet of Things, the interconnected everyday devices such as the smart refrigerator, offers more vulnerabilities to be hacked than ever before ??? but also more ways to scan for threats.???In newspapers there is not a single day where we don???t read about an organization being breached,??? he said. ???At a time when even coffee machines have IP [Internet protocol] addresses, many people in security teams don???t so much as have visibility of the network.???Where cybersecurity normally functions as a barrier to keep out previously identified threats, Aurora said Darktrace technology behaves more like a human immune system.???Once you understand the devices and people, once you notice subtle changes within the network, you establish a pattern of life, and whether it is lateral movement or unusual activity ??? maybe an employee using a device they don???t normally use, or a fingerprint scanner acting unusually ??? the immune system notices and takes action, detecting these things in network before they become a headline,??? he said.Darktrace???s package includes a 3D topographical real-time ???threat visualizer??? that monitors everyday network activity and the responsive Antigena system, which can decide for itself to slow systems down to give security personnel time to stop a potential breach, cut off network access to particular individuals, or mark specific e-mails for further investigation.???Let???s say an employee is made redundant and becomes a potential information threat, the machine will intelligently determine what is the problem, assess the mathematical threat and then decide what action is to be taken,???

152,Sports,"Antonio Conte on Sunday warned Chelsea not to take the English Premier League title for granted after the leaders cleared a major hurdle with a 3-0 win at Everton.Conte???s side consolidated their position on top of the table thanks to a steely display at Goodison Park, but second-placed Tottenham Hotspur remain hot on their heels.Pedro???s brilliant strike, then goals from Gary Cahill and Willian secured Chelsea???s fourth win in their past five league games, sparking jubilant celebrations from Conte and his players.With four matches remaining, Chelsea have a four-point advantage over Spurs and Mauricio Pochettino???s side can temporarily trim that gap to one point if they win at West Ham United on Friday, before the leaders host Middlesbrough the following Monday.Conte knows it would only take one slip to give Tottenham real hope of overhauling them and he cautioned his players against thinking the race is over, even if they do have an easier run-in than Spurs.???It is a great win, but at this part of the season every win is a great win for us,??? Conte said. ???For this reason we must celebrate in the right way, with my players, with the staff, with our fans. We have to have great enthusiasm and great patience, because we are having a great season, but to become a fantastic season we must win [the title]. The message to the players was not words, only hugs and enthusiasm. Now it???s important for us to prepare the right way for the next game. If we don???t win against Middlesbrough then you lose this great win.???On paper Chelsea appear to have a smooth path to the title as, following the clash with lowly Middlesbrough, they face West Bromwich Albion, Watford and relegated Sunderland.Conte tried his best not to look too far ahead, but even the cautious Italian could not completely hide his joy at a result that moved Chelsea a step closer to being crowned champions in his first season.???For sure it???s a great result for us. To win at Everton is not easy. My players showed me great patience to wait for the right moment to hit,??? Conte said.???It was important to keep the clean sheet after a few games without one. That???s good for our confidence. We finished a crucial week very well,??? he said. ???We all know there is this part of the season that is more important. We are having a fantastic season, but we must be calm.???After winning their previous eight home Premier League games, Everton were by far the strongest opponents left on Chelsea???s schedule and for 60 minutes they lived up to that billing.In the end, they crumbled under the pressure of Chelsea???s relentless probing and Everton manager Ronald Koeman admitted the Blues have the look of champions.Asked if Chelsea have title quality, Koeman said: ???Yes, especially in the last 30 minutes. They are confident in having a good defense.??????They wait for chances and are really clinical. Without playing on the highest level, they still won the game because they have that attacking quality,??? he said. ???One of the most difficult things is to create chances because they have a difficult system to play against. When they get a little more space they kill the game.???",1

Today was another chance to see the team learning and improving. It is so important now to try and win trophies, that is our aim.

Nadal said. ???It was hard. I was having a few more chances than him, but it was very even and that is why I celebrated with so much energy at the end.???The second set was a procession as Thiem???s frustration at his inability to break through Nadal???s defenses saw him consistently fire long.However, Thiem was not too disheartened after losing out to the King of Clay after what had been a productive week.???I really enjoyed the week in Barcelona,???

They do not expect the relationship to turn sour as it did between the Briton and Rosberg.???He [Bottas] took up that risky move to be Lewis Hamilton???s teammate, to take over the reigning world champion???s car, and I think that he has done a very good job,??? team boss Toto Wolff said. ???The relationship between the two is very intact, Lewis was one of the first to congratulate Valtteri on his first race victory and I think that shows the respect that they have towards each other. Nevertheless, both of them are fierce competitors, and they will want to win races and fight for a championship, but I don???t think it will affect the relationship and the dynamics within the team like it did in the last years between Nico and Lewis.???",1

158,World News,"A US-based human rights group says US President Donald Trump should seek accountability and not offer to roll out the White House red carpet for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who the group accuses of being a mass murder ???mastermind??? amid the thousands of deaths in his crackdown against drugs.Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other critics yesterday reacted with alarm and outrage at Trump???s invitation for Duterte to visit the White House in a telephone call where the Trump also affirmed the US??? treaty alliance and friendship with the Philippines and its new president, who has had an antagonistic stance toward US security policies.Left-wing Philippine group Bayan urged Duterte to reject Trump???s invitation, saying the visit would not change what it said was the US??? lopsided relations with its former colony.???It may provide an interesting photo op, but nothing more,??? Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said.The US and other nations close to the Philippines ???have an obligation to urge accountability for the victims of Duterte???s abusive drug war, rather than offer to roll out the red carpet for official state visits with its mastermind,??? HRW deputy director for Asia Phelim Kine said.Kine said separately in an e-mailed response to questions from the AP that Trump might be undertaking action inimical to human rights by adopting an overly friendly overture to Duterte, who is facing a complaint for alleged mass murder before the International Criminal Court.???Trump should recognize that he has cut a bad deal for the people of both the United States and the Philippines if he rolls out the red carpet for a Duterte visit without carefully weighing the implications of hosting and toasting a foreign leader whose links to possible crimes against humanity for instigating and inciting extrajudicial killings has already prompted warnings from the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court,??? he said.Duterte has said in the past that his administration did not have a policy backing extrajudicial killings, although he has repeatedly threatened drug suspects with death and unusual violence in his nationally televised speeches.Duterte???s spokesman Ernie Abella did not immediately reply to a request for reaction to HRW???s statement.The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said Duterte has not yet responded to Trump???s offer, adding that an official US invitation would kick off diplomatic arrangements for Duterte???s possible US trip.If Duterte accepts, the trip might happen soon because of the urgent topic, department spokesman Robespierre Bolivar told reporters.???The US apparently wants to consult allies and strategic partners in Asia to discuss an approach to the tensions over DPRK [Democratic People???s Republic of Korea],??? Bolivar said.???The discussion that transpired between the presidents was warm, with President Trump expressing his understanding and appreciation of the challenges facing the Philippine president, especially on the matter of dangerous drugs,???

159,World News,"Thailand???s junta chief has accepted an invitation to visit the White House from US President Donald Trump, his spokesman said yesterday, the latest autocrat to be embraced by the US leader.The offer came during a telephone conversation on Sunday night, part of a flurry of calls Trump made to Southeast Asian leaders over the weekend trying to shore up regional support over the troubled Korean peninsula.He on Sunday extended a White House invitation to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal campaign against drugs has claimed thousands of lives and led to warnings from rights groups about possible crimes against humanity.???The Prime Minister thanked and accepted President Trump???s invitation to visit the United States,??? junta spokesman Major General Werachon Sukhonhapatipak said in a statement, adding that the offer to visit had been reciprocated by Bangkok.Thailand???s former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power three years ago, anointing himself prime minister and ushering in the kingdom???s most autocratic government in a generation.The coup strained ties with the former US president Barack Obama administration as the military jailed dissidents, banned protests and ramped up prosecutions under its draconian lese-majeste law.However, the generals who now run Thailand ??? a former staunch US ally that has moved closer to Beijing since the coup ??? know they are now less likely to be berated for their dismal rights record under Trump, who has had much fewer qualms about embracing autocrats.He also called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to congratulate him on winning a controversial referendum that would dramatically increase his powers, and Trump???s rhetoric towards China, a popular punching bag during the campaign, has noticeably softened since his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) in Florida last month.Many Southeast Asian nations have looked to the Trump administration with some trepidation.He has shown little appetite for Obama???s Asia ???pivot??? and he swiftly scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal after taking office.Trump is due to visit two regional summits ??? in Vietnam and the Philippines ??? toward the end of the year.The Thai junta statement was light on specifics, but said Trump ???had confidence in the Thai government??? and that the two nations were ready to ???enhance bilateral cooperation in all dimensions.???Like Trump, the arch-royalist general Prayut enjoys berating the media and speaking off the cuff at length, including during weekly ???Bringing Happiness Back to Thailand??? speeches that are broadcast on all channels.",1
160,World News,"They might not have lost themselves in the music or the moment, but a judge and nine lawyers in a New Zealand courtroom did listen politely to Eminem???s Lose Yourself as a copyright trial involving the nation???s ruling political party began yesterday.The Detroit-based music publishers for Eminem are suing New Zealand???s conservative National Party, alleging the soundtrack for a 2014 election campaign ad copied the rapper???s acclaimed 2002 song. Titled Eminem Esque, the track has the familiar urgent, pulsing beat of the original.The party has previously said it purchased the track through an Australian-based supplier and does not believe it has infringed anyone???s copyright.When the case was filed in 2014, New Zealand Representative Steven Joyce said he thought the use of the song was ???pretty legal,??? and that Eminem???s team ???are just having a crack and a bit of an eye for the main chance because it???s an election campaign.???That response was widely ridiculed, including by comedian John Oliver on his show Last Week Tonight.???Pretty legal? That???s not a concept that exists. That???s like being sort-of dead,??? Oliver said.Spokespeople for both Joyce and the National Party yesterday said they would not be commenting while the case was before the court.Garry Williams, the lawyer for Eminem???s music publisher Eight Mile Style, told the New Zealand High Court in Wellington that the National Party had wanted a song that was edgy and modern, but showed the party was dependable. He said the music fared better with focus groups than a classical piece.He quoted from National Party e-mails, including one in which the song is described as an Eminem ???sound-alike??? and another in which an agent for the party wrote: ???I guess the question we???re asking, if everyone thinks it???s Eminem, and it???s listed as Eminem Esque, how can we be confident that Eminem doesn???t say we???re ripping him off????Williams said the e-mails showed it was ???utterly clear??? the party knew it was using a copyrighted song.Speaking outside the court, spokesman for Eminem???s music publishers Joel Martin said he was surprised the two sides had not settled and that going to trial against an entity like a governing political party was unusual and extraordinary.???The bottom line is we would never have permitted the use of the song in any political advertisement,??? he said.Martin said the publishers are seeking both a cash settlement for an undisclosed amount and an acknowledgment by the court that the National Party breached copyright.He said that by pursuing the case, they are showing they take copyright infringement around the world seriously.He said the political views of the National Party were not a factor: ???We are Americans and we don???t know about politics in New Zealand,??? he said.Judge Helen Cull ruled that some details in the case would remain confidential because they were commercially sensitive.The judge-only case is expected to last about six days and will determine whether copyright was breached. The amount of any damages would be decided later.",1

Zeid said, referring to fired officials and the wider nine-month crackdown.He also said he was ???very concerned about the renewed state of emergency,??? which Turkey extended by parliamentary vote on April 18, saying the decision was made amid ???a climate of fear in the country.??????Journalism is not a crime in Turkey, it is an issue the government must pay deep attention to,??? he added.Turning to Egypt, he said that the heavy-handed security measures by the government were fostering the very radicalization it is looking to curb.Zeid condemned the attacks on two Christian churches last month Islamic State group suicide bombers that killed 45 people, which led the government to declare a three-month state of emergency hours later.???A state of emergency, the massive numbers of detentions, reports of torture and continued arbitrary arrests ??? all of this we believe facilitates radicalization in prisons,??? Zeid said. ???Abetted by the crackdown on civil society through travel bans, freezing orders, anti-protest laws, this is in our opinion is not the way to fight terror.??????National security yes, must be a priority for every country, but again not at the expense of human rights,??? Zeid said.He also said that he hoped US President Donald Trump would convey to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte the deep sense of alarm about Duterte???s apparent shirking of his duty to prosecute human rights violations, when the two men meet in Washington.The UN is also continuing to receive signals that the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen could attack the port of Hodeidah, causing humanitarian suffering and loss of life, Zeid said.???The UN is concerned about the humanitarian repercussions of such an attack in terms of inflaming the humanitarian crisis even further, let alone our concerns about loss of civilian life were there to be a large-scale attack on port,??? he said.",1
162,World News,"The US and its African allies have called off their hunt for Joseph Kony, one of the world???s most wanted fugitives, who is blamed for the deaths of at least 100,000 people and the suffering of millions more in central Africa.Kony leads the Lord???s Resistance Army (LRA) and has a US$5 million price on his head. He was one of the first people the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague indicted for crimes against humanity.About 150 US Special Forces soldiers and more than 1,500 Ugandan troops have been hunting Kony for almost a decade across a swath of remote forest and brush along the borders of the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan.The 56-year-old is believed to be moving with between 20 and 30 loyal fighters, several wives, his two sons and hundreds of followers.Many analysts believe he is hiding in the disputed, mineral-rich area of Kafia Kingi in South Darfur, Sudan, from where he and his sons can organize smuggling operations undetected.Other groups loyal to the LRA, which Kony founded nearly 30 years ago, are scattered across central Africa.Ugandan troops earlier last month began leaving the Central African Republic. The US Special Forces, deployed as part of a billion-dollar mission to kill or capture Kony, have also begun to withdraw. Officials and senior soldiers in both Uganda and the US say the LRA is no longer a threat.???The mission to neutralize the LRA has now been successfully achieved,??? the Ugandan army said in a statement.Analysts say Kony and the LRA are a shadow of the threat they were 10 or even 20 years ago, when they could deploy thousands of fighters and terrorized wide areas of central Africa.???The LRA has been in survival mode for some time,??? said Ben Shepherd, an expert in central Africa at London???s Chatham House think tank.Pamela Faber at the Center for Naval Analyses in Washington said the group, which is much diminished by defections, internal purges and battle casualties, was a vestige of its former self.However, many say the LRA ??? known for atrocious brutality against civilians including mass abductions and rapes, executions and torture ??? could still cause serious harm.Norbert Mao, an opposition politician and former chairman of Gulu district in northern Uganda, where the group emerged in the 1980s, said the withdrawal of troops gave it a chance to regroup.???Now that the Uganda government is stopping the search for LRA, it might become a mercenary force that can be used by any other groups to terrorize civilians. They will be soldiers of fortune and that???s a threat to the region,??? he said.Kony is now unlikely to appear before the ICC, but the trial of Dominic Ongwen, one of his key lieutenants, started earlier this year. It has revealed appalling details of the LRA???s atrocities.The charges against Ongwen include murder, attempted murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, conscription of children under the age of 15 into an armed group and, for the first time, ???forced pregnancy??? and forced marriage.The group has been blamed for the deaths of about 100,000 people and the abduction of 60,000 children.Former LRA abductees say they were forced to maim and kill friends, neighbors and relatives, and participate in gruesome rites such as drinking their victims??? blood. Ongwen himself was abducted by the LRA when still a teenager.",1

She has been suspended pending impeachment proceedings, officials said.???She has interfered into the domains of the executive and must be removed,??? Nepali Congress lawmaker Chin Kaji Shrestha said.The Nepali Congress is the largest coalition member.Karki???s supporters say she has taken a strong stance against corruption during her time as head of the Supreme Court.A committee will be established to investigate the allegations of bias, after which parliament will vote on whether to impeach her.However, the process is unlikely to get that far as she is due to retire next month when she turns 65.Analysts say the move to unseat a judge known for delivering judgments free of the influence of politics or personal ties was an attack on the independence of judiciary.It has raised the danger of the parliamentary majority being used against constitutional bodies that do not obey political leaders,??? constitutional expert Bipin Adhikari said.Nepal has set elections to 744 village and municipal councils for May 14 and June 14.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the third-largest group in the coalition, was due to meet yesterday to consider whether to remain in the coalition if the impeachment motion is not withdrawn.Additional reporting by AFP",1

165,World News,"A global slime-making craze sparked by social media has prompted safety concerns over the use of the cleaning product borax.Also known as sodium borate, borax has a range of household uses including as an insecticide, a stain remover and a deodorizer. It is also a pivotal ingredient of home-made slime, a perennial art or science project in which it is mixed with water, glue and food coloring.Slime has recently undergone a global resurgence, with Google searches climbing steadily in the past 12 months and accelerating this year.In February, Elmer???s Glue said an increase in sales in the US in the second half of last year were ???due in large part to slime mania??? and, in March, the Today show reported that schools around the US had banned slime for being ???too distracting??? and messy.Borax, a naturally occurring mineral, is also a mild irritant and there have been concerns over children???s safety following reports of it inducing burns.An 11-year-old girl in Rockland, Massachusetts, suffered second and third-degree burns to her hands that were attributed to prolonged exposure to borax after making slime every day for several months.???I love it, a lot,??? the girl told local news media of slime in March. ???Don???t make it, don???t play with it.???In February, a Manchester, England, woman posted photographss of chemical burns on her daughter???s hands on Facebook as a warning to other parents. It was shared 820 times.???My little Queen has been making slime off YouTube ... 3 weeks later we are looking at plastic surgery on her hands from a burns department at Hospital,??? she wrote.According to the non-profit, non-partisan Environmental Working Group in the US, borax can have short and long-term health effects, with irritation possible following skin or eye contact, inhalation or ingestion.In the long term, it may disrupt hormones and harm the male reproductive system, with chronic exposure to high doses of borax linked to a greater risk of decreased sperm count and libido.Kate Copping of Melbourne told Guardian Australia that her 10-year-old daughter, Daisy, started making slime about six months ago after having come across it on YouTube.???She has been making it nonstop. We are going to buy glue constantly,???

166,World News,"Chaz Wing was 12 when they cornered him in the school bathroom. The students who tormented him were children, too, entering the age of pimples and cracking voices.Eventually, he swore under oath, the boys raped him and left him bleeding, the culmination of a year of harassment.Though Wing repeatedly told teachers and administrators about the insults and physical attacks, he did not report being sexually assaulted until a year later, launching a long legal fight over whether his school had done enough to protect him.Wing???s saga is more than a tale of escalating bullying. Across the US, thousands of students have been sexually assaulted by other students, in high schools, junior-highs and even elementary schools ??? a hidden horror educators have long been warned not to ignore.Relying on state education records, supplemented by federal crime data, a year-long investigation by The Associated Press (AP) uncovered about 17,000 official reports of sex assaults by students over a four-year period, from fall 2011 to spring 2015.That figure represents the most complete tally yet of sexual assault among the US??? 50 million students in grades K-12.However, it also does not fully capture the problem: Such attacks are greatly under-reported, some states do not track them, and those that do vary widely in how they classify and catalog sexual violence.REPUTATIONS AT STAKEWith school reputations and funding at stake, there is tremendous pressure to hide such violence. Even under varying state laws, acknowledging an incident can trigger liabilities and requirements to act.???No principal wants their school to be the rape school,??? said Bill Howe, a former teacher who spent 17 years overseeing Connecticut???s compliance with a federal law that helps protect student victims of at-school sexual assault. ???It???s the courageous principal that does the right thing.???The attacks AP tracked ranged from rape and sodomy to forced oral sex and fondling.Assaults occurred anywhere students were left unsupervised: buses and bathrooms, hallways and locker rooms. No type of school was immune, whether it be in a wealthy suburb, inner city or farm town, and all types of children were targeted.Children remained most vulnerable to peer-on-peer sexual assault in the privacy of a home, the analysis of the federal crime data showed.However, schools were the No. 2 place where they were sexually violated by other children.INCIDENTS JUMP AT AGE 10About 5 percent of reported attacks involved five and six-year-olds. Incidents jumped between ages 10 and 11 ??? typically the start of middle school ??? and continued rising until age 14, when they began dropping as students progressed through high school.Unwanted fondling was the most common form of assault and about one in five of the abused kids were penetrated in some way.The data also showed sexual assaults by peers were more common than those by teachers, which receive far more attention. For every adult-on-child sexual attack reported at school, there were seven by students.???Schools are required to keep students safe,??? said Charol Shakeshaft, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who specializes in school sexual misconduct. ???It is part of their mission. It is part of their legal responsibility. It isn???t happening. Why don???t we know more about it and why isn???t it being stopped????",1

I do,??? he added.???I am not sure I can turn something into a political movement, but I think there is a body of ideas out there people would support,??? Blair said.He said his push was not about defying the vote to leave the EU.Blair said leaving the European single market and seeking a free-trade agreement, as is Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May???s intention, would be ???relegating ourselves??? from the top order.Opinion polls put the Conservatives far ahead of Labour a few weeks out from the general election.Blair, who won three straight general elections as Labour leader, was from the most centrist strain of the party, while current leader Jeremy Corbyn is from its strident leftist wing that reviles Blairite politics.???Unless you are providing answers for the future you are not going to win,???

168,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

(RSF) new Taipei-based Asia bureau says. ???When I???m writing a press release, I won???t be trying to balance between, say, [Hong Kong???s] freedom fighters and the Chinese government. I???m making a choice, because in the matters we are dealing with, not making a choice is already giving in to the strongest.???Alviani, who has lived in Taiwan for 17 years, says he jumped at the opportunity when he heard that the Paris-based press freedom watchdog was planning to open its first Asia bureau. A graduate of the University of Strasbourg???s School of Journalism, Alviani worked for a regional newspaper for two years before moving to Thailand to work for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of his military service.The job later brought him to Taiwan, where he cofounded Infine Communications, which focuses on project management and consulting for various cultural activities. He also started the Taiwan European Film Festival and served as director of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry.???I don???t see it as a job,??? he says of his new gig. ???I had a job. This is a mission.???A SAFE DISTANCEAlviani says he was involved in the decision to set up RSF???s office in Taipei instead of Hong Kong, which has seen its press freedom ranking plummet in the past five years. The culprit is China, he says, which censors anything sensitive to the government and flexes its muscles to influence other governments and private businesses.???China is stressing the fact that you can have freedom of information with limitations,??? he says. ???That???s something we don???t agree with. Freedom is something that you either have or you don???t.???Alviani says since Hong Kong is one of the most crucial areas in his bureau???s battle for press freedom, he didn???t feel safe setting up office there.???It???s not always a good idea to build your headquarters on the frontlines,??? he says. ???We would be worried that our team could face intimidation, our communications might be under surveillance, and after a couple of months or years we might be asked to leave.???Although the office is located in Taipei, Taiwan won???t be a priority for the bureau as it boasts the most liberal press in Asia. While the focus will be on China, Hong Kong and North Korea, Alviani says that they will remain critical of Taiwan???s media environment as well as that of other democracies such as South Korea and Japan.He adds that Taiwanese authorities shouldn???t be satisfied with being first in Asia.???I wish Taiwan wasn???t the best in the area (while keeping the same score), because there are still things to improve on here,??? he says. ???We don???t want to say everything is great ??? but Taiwan is still moving in a good direction while other Asian countries are not.???SPREADING THE WORDAlviani says his first priorities are to develop a network of correspondents in the region who can provide first-hand information as well as translating all information into local languages.???It???s important that we???re able to communicate in different languages, because the best thing we can do is to bring the problems to the attention of the public and let them decide,??? he says, noting the futility of directly asking a government or organization to change their ways.",1

Precinct polivr had Liu under surveillance for some time because he was suspected of heading a narcotics ring and using drugs to recruit addicts to be dealers, it said.Officers tried to apprehend him yesterday morning after an arrest warrant was issued, the department said.Liu resisted arrest and fled toward Jhonghe with the police in pursuit, leading to a firefight on the streets in which 30 shots were exchanged, police said.Liu then entered a residence on Lane 410, Jingsin Street (??¡Â??¢X???), it said.The police officers who had been pursing Liu retreated some distance from the building and a SWAT team was called in to cordon off the alley and warn local residents before negotiations began, the department said.Liu supposedly had a grenade in addition to guns and threatened to commit suicide during the negotiations.He also demanded to see his girlfriend, who police escorted to the scene to talk with Liu after putting body armor on her.After three hours of negotiations, Liu laid down his weapons and surrendered, police said.Liu is also a suspect in several violent crimes reportedly connected to urban development projects in Taipei???s Zhongshan District (????¡Ó¡Ó) and the attempted blackmail of a man surnamed Shao (???) for NT$3 million (US$99,279), police said.During the standoff, the police department???s priority was protecting bystanders and local residents, and triple security lines were established to keep residents from being taken hostage, Criminal Investigation Corps Commander Liao Hsun-cheng (?????????) said.New Taipei City Police Department Commissioner Hu Mu-yuan (?????????) said Liu had apparently acted out of fear of facing 18 years or more in prison for resisting arrest, drugs and other charges.Officers talking with Liu kept telling him that he would not be sentenced to life in prison or to death and that he would be likely to receive parole if he behaves well in prison, Hu said.A prosecutor who was also at the scene told Liu that he would be treated with leniency if he surrendered, Hu said.Meanwhile, a family member of murdered former Taoyuan county commissioner Liu Pang-yu (?????????) yesterday denied that Liu Pang-cheng was a cousin of the dead man, as some local media reports had claimed.Liu Pang-yu???s family lived in Taoyuan???s Jhongli (????¢G¢F) and Pingjhen (??????) districts, and although there are many people in the generation who carry the word Pang (???) in their given names, no one by the name Liu Pang-cheng is known to the family, the relative said.The family deeply mourns Liu Pang-yu and does not wish to see his reputation or that of his relatives tarnished by erroneous information, the relative said.Liu Pang-yu and six others were killed in an execution-style slaying at his residence on Nov. 21, 1996, a case that was never solved.Additional reporting by Lee Jung-ping",1

Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2

Chan said on Facebook, referring to KMT Vice Chairman Hau Lung-bin (?????????), who said he would nominate Gou as the party???s presidential candidate if he is elected KMT chairman.Chan said the KMT should not cling to wishful thinking and rely on people outside of the party to win the next presidential election, because a last-minute refusal from the candidate could disrupt the party???s campaign strategy and result in the nomination of an unsuitable candidate.That could lead to a repeat of what happened in last year???s presidential election campaign, during which the KMT replaced its original candidate, KMT Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu (????¡±???¡Ó), with New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu (??¡Ó??????) only three months before the vote due to Hung???s falling approval rating, Chan said.Touting his friendship with Gou, Chan said he contacted the businessman last year for a loan when the KMT was facing financial difficulties after its bank accounts were frozen by the Executive Yuan???s Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.???The incident goes to show our [close] relationship. We have talked about the 2020 race before, but Gou should be the one answering the question??? about whether he wants to represent the KMT in the next presidential election, Chan said.Gou???s mother loaned the KMT NT$45 million (US$1.49 million) in October last year when the party was struggling to pay its employees.Gou last week attracted public attention after he was filmed walking out of the White House on Thursday and Friday during a trip to Washington to discuss a potential investment in the US.The White House yesterday confirmed that Gou on Friday briefly met with US President Donald Trump.Chan said the KMT should engage in self-reflection and explore ways to attract talent from various sectors of society to join the party.The party should propose policies that would touch the voters, instead of capitalizing on Gou???s influence, he added.However, the Facebook post was edited hours later to remove the parts about Chan asking Gou for a loan and Hau capitalizing on the businessman.Hau yesterday again pointed at Gou as the only person that stands a chance of defeating President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) in the next presidential election.???A party leader should be selfless and think about nothing but ???winning.???

Zhou wrote in a note. ???On the other hand, the deleveraging effort by the Chinese authorities, has started to work.???The employment sub-index slipped to 49.2 from 50 in March while the raw materials inventories sub-index was unchanged at 48.3.Growth in China???s services sector slowed slightly to 54 last month, compared with the previous month???s reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014.China???s economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and the nation???s gravity-defying property boom.However, growth is expected to slow as authorities step up a battle to cool the property sector, and as the central bank and banking regulator take steps to contain financial risks.Some analysts say China???s economic growth might have peaked in the first quarter, but that it is on track to hit a target of about 6.5 percent this year.China???s producer price inflation in March cooled for the first time in seven months as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter, despite robust property investment.The private sector Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, is to be published tomorrow.The Caixin/Markit PMI is expected to come in at 51 for last month, according to a Reuters poll of economists, down from 51.2 in March.",1

Rada Gancheva, 58, said.The comforting hoots, whistles and puffs of steam trains have proved a big moneymaker for Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ), earning it 250,000 euros (US$272,388) last year.???The Vitosha Express diesel train of [former communist Bulgarian president] Todor Zhivkov will soon be made available also,??? BDZ???s chief executive officer Georgy Drumev said.However, the success belies the dire state of the railways in the EU???s poorest nation.According to a 2015 Boston Consulting Group study, Bulgarian trains have the worst quality and safety record among 25 European nations surveyed.The number of Bulgarians using trains halved between 2000 and 2015 and the volume of freight is a 10th of what it was in the 1980s, Georgy Minchev of the Freight Transport Association said.Creaking infrastructure, aging locomotives and rolling stock mean that the average train speed is just 55kph. The 440km trip from Sofia to Varna on the Black Sea takes eight hours ??? and that is on the so-called ???express train.??????We started with a 40-minute delay and it grew to four hours by the time we arrived in Varna, making it a 12-hour journey,??? one traveler, Maria Damyanova, 48, said.Horror stories abound on the Internet about people???s experiences, particularly in winter when the simplest journey can turn into a nightmare.???Iron nerves and plenty of food are needed if you want to take the train in Bulgaria,??? read a social media entry by Margarit Blagoev, 35.People are sometimes forced to take extreme measures.In January, 50 frustrated passengers jumped off their regional train when it was brought to a stop mid-journey and stood on the adjacent tracks in the path of an oncoming express train to make it stop and allow their train to head off first.The BDZ is saddled with debts of 240 million euros, hindering investment and renovation.Obsolete infrastructure, and thefts of bits of track and signaling systems make derailments common, especially of cargo trains.A freight train transporting gas in December last year derailed and exploded, killing six people, injuring dozens more and devastating a small village in the northeast.However, after failing for years to attract funds, help might be on the way from China, which is seeking to invest heavily in infrastructure projects in eastern Europe and elsewhere.The China Railway Rolling Stock Corp (????????????) group has pledged to reimburse 130 million euros of BDZ???s debts and invest 170 million euros in new trains, according to the Bulgarian Ministry of Transport.In addition, it has offered to invest 300 million euros in a new train assembly plant.The Bulgarian government is studying the proposals.However, not everyone in Bulgaria is pleased at the prospect.???This offer will result in a mere restructuring of the debt and to new borrowing due to the BDZ???s overindebtedness,??? economist Georgy Angelov said. ???The project will aggravate the risk of bankruptcy.???",1

It???s a dead weight,??? Angelino Ghinelli tweeted into a social media storm that has not gone unnoticed in Rome, where ministers have so far shown a strong reluctance to make any guarantees.???Enough with saving Alitalia,??? wrote Cinzia Briguglio, one of about 1,000 signatories to an online petition that sprang up last week, calling for the Italian government not to get involved.Consumer groups have also chimed in, including one, Codacons, which has threatened to ask Italy???s Corte dei Conti, a judicial auditor, to examine any state bailout.The court can fine officials, including ministers, for wasting public funds.An opinion poll published on Friday, four days after Alitalia workers voted to reject a union-backed rescue plan proposed by management, showed that 77 percent of Italians believed the airline should be left to fail.???It???s clear Italians are opposed to governments systematically running up deficits to deal with companies in crisis,??? Index Research director Natascia Turato said in a comment the firm posted online, along with its poll results.Without state support, Alitalia appears headed for collapse.

202,Business,"US President Donald Trump???s plans to slash corporate taxes in the US have sparked concerns of a new global fiscal race to the bottom, possibly involving a wave of negative social consequences, experts say.In what Trump???s economic adviser Gary Cohn described as ???the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986, and one of the biggest tax cuts in American history,??? the White House plans to dramatically cut taxes for US businesses and individuals, slashing the corporate tax from a top rate of 35 percent to 15 percent.The aim, according to US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, is to ???bring back trillions of [US] dollars that are offshore to be invested here in the United States??? and create jobs.Trump???s goal is for the reforms to propel the US economy to 3 percent annual growth.However, the long-anticipated overhaul ??? details of which remain unclear beyond a handful of headline measures ??? could face stiff opposition in the US Congress, including from some Republicans, with lawmakers sharply divided over the prospect of fuelling already-rising deficits.The plans have also raised eyebrows at non-governmental and non-profit organizations.They could accelerate ???the race to tax competition on an international level and all of us will pay the price,??? Oxfam spokeswoman Manon Aubry told reporters.???When the world???s most powerful country decides to slash tax revenues as much as this, a number of other countries may follow suit, bringing with it imbalances that will have enormous impacts on our societies,??? she said.Falling tax revenues would make it harder for governments to pay for welfare, healthcare and other benefits without going too deep into the red, she said.To make up the shortfall, governments could be tempted to hike valued-added tax, often criticized for placing a disproportionate tax burden on the less well-off, Aubry said.???The cut in corporate taxes in the US will fuel tensions between countries,??? said Jean-Pierre Lieb, a tax lawyer at consultants EY.Corporate taxes in the US are the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, followed by France with a rate of 34 percent, Belgium with 33 percent and Australia with 30 percent. The OECD average is about 24 percent.However, to become more attractive, a number of countries have decided to lower their corporate tax rates.Britain is planning to cut its rate from 20 percent to 17 percent in 2020, a decision that predates Trump???s move and was strongly prompted by fears that corporations might find the UK less attractive place after it leaves the EU.There were even plans to cut the rate to 15 percent to help with Brexit woes, British papers have reported, but British Prime Minister Theresa May appears to have ruled out such a deep cut for now.France, meanwhile, is poised to take its corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 28 percent in 2020.Other countries, including Italy and Israel, have similar ambitions.???What we???re seeing is a headlong rush??? said Lieb, pointing to the case of Hungary where the corporate tax rate is to be slashed from 19 percent to just 9 percent.However, even if Trump succeeds in pushing through his planned cuts, countries such as Ireland, which have used their low tax rates to woo foreign companies like Google and Apple Inc, still expect to remain attractive.",1

205,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2

Sadly, the public???s impression of her is that whenever she makes a speech, be it on a big or small occasion and no matter whether her speech is long or short, she is always clutching a script from which she reads every word without ever raising her eyes.When the speaker is uninspiring, the listener is uninspired. Tsai no longer shows any sign of her lively and friendly side, or of her wisdom as a prominent intellectual.National leaders??? success might stem from their verbal skill, their charisma, their good governance or their closeness to the public. How can Tsai put this nation back on its feet, establish democratic discipline and foster decent public behavior? I humbly and sincerely offer the following suggestions:First, the president should climb out of her ivory tower, meet people face to face and engage in frank and honest dialogue with her constituents.Second, she should greatly reduce the amount of ???state secrets.??? The more secrets there are, the more doubtful and suspicious the public will be. Most ???secrets??? are really unnecessary and only serve to satisfy the sense of superiority of a handful of people who have a monopoly on the information.The government should not just let the public know how things are, but also why things are the way they are. For example, what would be the harm in calling China ???China??? and Taiwan ???Taiwan????What harm would it do if the legislature passed a normal referendum law like those of other democratic nations? What harm would come from freezing or abolishing the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Taiwan Provincial Government? What negative impact could answering these questions possibly have on ???national security????Third, Taiwan could set a trend by doing something even advanced democracies have not done.

207,Editorials,"Two important bills have passed their third readings in the legislature. One was an amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act (????????????), passed on April 20, and the other was an amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act (?????¢F???????????????), which was passed on Tuesday. These two amendments have the same purpose: to secure financing for Taiwan???s long-term care services.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has exerted a great deal of effort in pushing the amendments and those aged 60 and older are certain to feel the benefits. However, looking at what kind of policies should be made a priority in terms of national development, this is policy for older people and it is less urgent than coming up with policies for the young.The two amendments originated with changes to the Long-Term Care Services Act (??¡P?????¡±??¡±?????????) passed last year, according to which long-term care should be financed by the tobacco, estate and gift taxes.The amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act adds NT$20 (US$0.66) to the tax on every pack of cigarettes, which will now total NT$31.8 per pack. According to the government???s calculations, this will contribute NT$23.346 billion to long-term care every year.The amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act changes the tax rate from a flat 10 percent to a three-tiered incremental tax of 10, 15 and 20 percent. The government estimates that this would contribute NT$6.3 billion to long-term care per year.Two legislative sessions have passed since the DPP government took office and since these are the bills it has focused on, it is clear that they constitute its main policy focus.The increase in the tobacco tax is aimed at public health issues such as tobacco hazard prevention, something most people can agree with.However, the estate and gift tax adjustments set off a wave of calls to reduce taxes, after the government???s policy direction became clear last year. The calls have extended to calls for adjustment to the taxes on cash, shares, real estate and insurance.Since neither Singapore nor Hong Kong or the rest of China have an estate tax, there have even been examples of wealthy people voting with their feet to protect their property. Experience bears this out: After the estate tax was cut to 10 percent in 2009, the government???s fiscal revenue remained about the same as it was before the amendment, when the tax stood at 50 percent.In other words, this source of fiscal revenue is unstable and it is questionable if the Ministry of Finance???s estimates will be met. It will be necessary to pay attention to the effect this will have on capital.However, these issues are not the point of this editorial. Considering Taiwan???s problems, more attention should be given to policies aimed at the young instead of focusing on the elderly. At the very least, the two groups should be given the same weight.If priority is given to policies for the elderly, that could remove all room for policies for young people. That would be a great mistake.The danger posed to Taiwan by a falling birth rate and an aging population is common knowledge. Let us leave aside immigration policies for the moment and focus on these two issues alone.We cannot stop people from growing old or reduce the number of elderly people, so if we are to change the demographic structure, there is only one way to go: encouraging families to have children.",1
208,Editorials,"The nation???s economic achievements were once internationally renowned, but economic growth has widened the ever-expanding gap between rich and poor.The lack of a bicameral legislature, of effective supervision of the executive offices and of government oversight in balanced regional development has caused cities that once flourished economically to decline in administrative functionality simply because of their distance from the capital.As young people migrate to Taipei with the promise of higher salaries, other cities continue to become more marginalized.Take Pingtung for example: the nation???s southernmost city, which has seen a population reduction of 46,930 people since 2010. The political and economic center of Taipei has been unconcerned with the city at the island???s southern tip since the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) moved to Taiwan from China.Pingtung has received proportionally far fewer national resources than other large cities. Many people in the city are concerned that it is becoming increasingly lethargic and that they might soon lose a legislative representative, which would reduce the say of Pingtung???s people in the Legislative Yuan.In the absence of ???economic human rights??? and protection from the federal government under the constitutional system, the decline of Pingtung epitomizes the nation???s economic development.It is unfortunate that this phenomenon has failed to garner the attention of the media, which are mostly located in Taipei, making Pingtung???s unbalanced development even more invisible to officials in the capital.A group has filed a petition through the government petition platform for the high-speed railway to be extended to Pingtung (https://goo.gl/34qnUM).The petition as of yesterday had been signed by 6,055 people, reaching the platform???s threshold within a week, whereas typically only about 4.7 percent of petitions are able to meet the requirements.The strong voice of these people has gathered great interest and attention from Taiwanese. The Pingtung County commissioner, as well as several social activism groups, have echoed the petition???s call to raise awareness about the importance of communication construction in Pingtung.Pingtung residents have come together on this issue, hoping for more balanced regional development and equality in economic rights. They believe that the government???s investment in communication infrastructure would be an important symbol of the government???s willingness to improve regional imbalance and economic inequality.For decades, Taipei has been the prime subject of consideration for resources and government policies. It does not favor local industrial transformation and innovation when talent and resources are concentrated in metropolitan regions.As most corporate headquarters and funds are concentrated in Taipei, other regions are forced to face population loss, lack of funding for infrastructure and fewer employment opportunities.As the economies in these regions continue to suffer, the gap between rich and poor continues to increase. Such hardships would undoubtedly become long-term challenges for rural regions.It is therefore all the more critical to come up with strategies to face these challenges, to eliminate domestic inequality and opposition, and to form alliances with other nations on the basis of the common goal of attaining regional balance and equal opportunity for all.",1
209,Editorials,"At a time when South Korea is struggling to deter North Korea???s nuclear threats, human rights advocates say its military is targeting gay soldiers in its ranks.In recent weeks, the army has focused on dozens of those soldiers in what rights groups say is a campaign against gay men in the 620,000-member military.At least 32 have faced criminal charges of ???sodomy or other disgraceful conduct,??? according to the domestic news media and lawyers and rights advocates familiar with the cases.On Tuesday night, the issue of gay rights became a focus in South Korea???s presidential race, when the candidate who leads in the polls, Moon Jae-in, joined some of the other contenders in saying that he opposed homosexuality.Critics said the statement was a tactic to win support among conservative voters.Moon made the comment during a debate in which the issue of the military???s treatment of gays was raised. Under the conscript system, all eligible men are required to serve about two years.However, the Military Criminal Act outlaws sodomy and other unspecified ???disgraceful conduct??? between servicemen, whether or not there is mutual consent and whether or not that conduct takes place on military compounds. Those found to have violated the act face up to two years in prison.The army declined to provide details on its investigation.However, it said that it was not cracking down on gay soldiers; instead it said that it was trying to root out sodomy and other homosexual activities, which right-wing Christian groups have called a growing blight on its readiness to fight North Korea???s 1.2 million-member military.However, in the past week, evidence has emerged to support the allegations by gay soldiers that investigators flouted the army???s own regulations on how to treat gay service members by preying upon the soldiers??? fear of shame and abuse if they are outed in the military.Analysts and veterans said bullying, hazing and sexual violence were chronic problems in the South Korean army.In a series of telephone conversations secretly recorded in March and last month, an army investigator warned a gay sergeant against seeking help from lawyers or the National Human Rights Commission of Korea.In one conversation, the investigator complained that another gay soldier refused to cooperate with the inquiry and wanted to hire a lawyer.???If he hires a lawyer, that means he is outing himself,??? the investigator says in the recording, uploaded to the Web site of the Seoul-based Military Human Rights Center for Korea.It is unknown how many gay soldiers were punished under the anti-sodomy law before the recent flurry of charges.Gay soldiers said they feared that they were being scapegoated in the recent inquiry as part of an effort by the army to contain sexual abuse.In a survey of 671 veterans commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission in 2004, more than 15 percent said they had been sexually abused.Advocates say that by punishing gay soldiers, the government was sending the wrong message in South Korea, where the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are a largely taboo and politically unpopular subject. Powerful right-wing Christian groups have intensified a campaign against homosexuality, scuttling a bill that would have given sexual minorities the same protection as other minorities.",1
210,Editorials,"North Korea observers have long marveled at the ability of a small, impoverished, autocratic nation to go toe-to-toe with the world???s superpowers.Part of the secret to North Korea???s success has always been the ruling Kim family???s mastery of the art of brinkmanship.What looks to outsiders like bluster, bombast and recklessness is actually a proven technique that over the years has won North Korea grudging respect from Washington and its allies, and has at times filled its coffers with aid offered by rivals relieved to see animosity on the Korean Peninsula ease.However, the roles might have reversed, with a new administration in Washington bulldozing its way to the brink before finally backing away.Korean war jitters made global headlines after US President Donald Trump issued repeated, ambiguous warnings about his willingness to take unilateral action and sent US military vessels to Korean waters.However, last week, Trump announced a much softer policy that combines diplomacy and economic sanctions and is strikingly similar to what frustrated past US presidents embraced.North Korea used to employ a comparable method: forcing the world to pay attention by staging nuclear and missile tests, issuing outrageous threats and occasionally lashing out with violence ??? and then offering negotiations.For decades, the tiny, Third-World dictatorship sandwiched between rich behemoths played the game remarkably well.However, some now see North Korea entering a frightening new phase, barreling across what were once considered ???red lines??? in a dash to build nuclear-armed missiles that can reach the US mainland.Here is a brief examination of North Korea???s mastery of brinkmanship and what might be coming next:US BRINKMANSHIP?Brinkmanship can be defined as the technique of pushing a dangerous policy to the edge of safety before stopping.Some Korea experts, analyzing what happened in recent weeks on the Korean Peninsula, believe that this time Washington engineered the brinkmanship.Presumably worried that North Korea would soon conduct its sixth nuclear test, the Trump administration threatened a possible attack, ordered a supercarrier and nuclear-powered submarine to Korea and linked the US bombing of Syria to North Korea.???They were putting the idea of a surprise military action out there, which is the definition of a dangerous policy on the Korean Peninsula,??? John Delury, an Asia expert and professor at Seoul???s Yonsei University, said of the US moves.Trump seemed to think he could pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons and, if that failed, would then consider a pre-emptive strike, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul???s Dongguk University.North Korea, for its part, was relatively restrained, analysts said.Yes, North Korea expressed anger, as it does every year, over annual springtime joint military exercises by Seoul and Washington that the North calls preparations for an invasion.However, its response did not go beyond what happens most years. That included bellicose threats, a [failed] missile test linked to the celebration of the birthday of North Korea???s founder Kim Il-sung and war games during the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People???s Army.NUCLEAR AND MISSILE TESTSA big part of North Korea???s past brinkmanship has always involved its weapons program.

It has helped me a great deal that I can occasionally just go galloping into the woods with my friends. It somehow balances my mind.???Like a real horse and its rider, the hobbyhorse and its master form a team and become attached to each other. Similarly, the sports simulates traditional equestrian events including competing in dressage and show jumping, and is physically demanding.Some actual horse riders may look down on hobby-horsing as childlike past-time not suitable for anyone aged over 10, but Equestrian Federation of Finland secretary-general Fred Sundwall disagrees.???We think it???s simply wonderful that hobby-horsing has become a phenomenon and so popular,??? Sundwall said. ???It gives a chance to those children and teens who don???t own horses to interact with them also outside stables and riding schools.???The vast majority of the hobbyhorses are homemade ???splendid, colorful creatures complete with names like Chattanooga Choo Choo and Panda ??? exchanged and sold by owners at events and through social media. Some of them have been known to fetch up to 200 euros (US$218 dollars) at auctions.Aficionados take high pride in the sport???s do-it-yourself attitude and very few industrially made hobbyhorses are seen at events because they are ???lower-caste horses,??? said Venla-Maria Uutela, a spokeswoman for a registered informal hobbyhorse society in Helsinki.About 10,000 people, nearly all of them between the ages of 10 and 18, are estimated to be involved in hobby-horsing in Finland. Its popularity is also growing steadily in the other Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe, though the numbers are much smaller.Regional competition events are arranged and organized by volunteers throughout Finland, culminating in national championships every year.This year???s main event took place late this month at a packed sports hall in Helsinki, attracting an estimated 1,000 spectators to watch about 200 participants competing with their hobbyhorses in several subcategories.???It???s very bizarre for other people to see, for the first time especially, this kind of stuff,??? said Taija Turkki, an 18-year-old hobbyhorse coach. ???Because they think we think the horse is alive, which we do not. We understand that it???s dead, made of fabric and all that.???Lack of strict rules and pompous ceremonies, strong social media presence and female bonding are a big part of the attraction.???Freedom to create and imagination are key aspects into why people start hobby-horsing,??? said Aarniomaki, a hobbyhorse veteran who does not compete actively anymore, but is keen on organizing related events such as a recent hobbyhorse parade through the streets of Helsinki.",1

216,Sports,"It never happened in the decade when the prosaic nature of his heavyweight domination quite underwhelmed boxing, but, at the age of 41, Wladimir Klitschko on Saturday belatedly earned proper appreciation for his greatness.How ironic, though, that it had to come in defeat.The veteran Ukrainian warrior came agonizingly close to becoming only the second fighter after George Foreman to win a recognized version of the world title as a forty-something before being stopped by Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium in London.Bruised, battered and with a deep cut by his left eye, he could only reflect ruefully on having failed to follow up his sixth round knock-down of Joshua aggressively enough, feeling he had let the Briton off the hook.Yet, although a 14-year age gap and Joshua???s fitness, strength and power eventually saw him floored twice and finally rescued by the referee in the 11th round, Klitschko still felt like a winner at the end of an exhilarating evening.Ninety thousand fans at Wembley seemed to agree as the man who was so often damned with faint praise during 11 years of heavyweight dominance received much greater acclaim here than he had after many of his mundane victories.Often portrayed as being too safety-first and mechanical in approach, here was a very different ???Dr Steelhammer,??? stung into desperate defiance after Joshua had sent him crashing to his knees with a fifth-round assault.It looked for all money like the end for the man who had appeared well past his sell-by-date in a sorry dethroning at the hands of Tyson Fury some 17 months earlier, but as Klitschko himself said: ???I took a beating, but I recovered well.???Indeed, in what was perhaps the most courageous couple of minutes in his two-decade professional career, Klitschko fought back dazzlingly, one big left hook setting up a counter-attack so ferocious that by the end of the round it was Joshua who was looking almost out on his feet.After following up with a booming right cross in the next which saw Joshua felled for the first time in his professional career, Klitschko made what he felt was a crucial, fight-turning error.???I thought he wouldn???t get up. Big respect to AJ. From that moment, I think I should have done more straight after he went down,??? he said. ???But I was pretty sure it was going to be my night so I took my time.???Big mistake. Joshua was given a breather and when he clawed his way back in the later stages, finding a ???second wind,??? his wicked body shots began to sap Klitschko???s stamina, setting up the painful denouement.As the Wembley crowd cheered him afterward, though, Klitschko started to appreciate that the historic contest had elevated the reputations of all involved.???I think Joshua and I both did great, I think we did a lot for the sport in the way we performed and how we respected and treated each other,??? he said. ???It was a great night for boxing and the fans. You will probably be surprised by my statement, but I don???t feel like I lost.??????Tonight, we all won. I didn???t get the belts but I didn???t feel like I lost ??? not my name, my face, nor my reputation. It was great to be involved in such an amazing occasion,??? Klitschko said.This did not sound like a man who was quite ready to hang up his gloves and he had not looked like one either as he often outboxed his old sparring partner, teaching Joshua more in one night than he had learned in his other 18 bouts combined.",1

His body has been recovered from the site and been taken to Lukla in Nepal, where the only airport in the Mount Everest area is located.It was not clear how Steck died, but he was planning to climb Mount Everest and nearby Mount Lhotse next month.He was the first casualty in the spring mountaineering season in Nepal that began last month and ends in May.Hundreds of foreign climbers are on the mountains to attempt scaling Himalayan peaks in May when there are a few windows of favorable weather.Steck was one of the most-renowned mountaineers of his generation.He was best known for his speed-climbing, including setting several records for ascending the north face of the Eiger, a classic mountaineering peak in the Bernese Alps in Switzerland, that he climbed in two hours and 47 minutes without using a rope.In 2013 he achieved the first solo climb of the Annapurna south face in Nepal after almost losing his life in a fall there in 2007. For that he received the Piolet d???Or ??? considered the Oscar of mountaineering ??? the following year.In 2015, Steck decided to climb all 82 peaks in the Swiss Alps higher than 4,000 meters traveling between mountains by foot, bike and paraglider only.He completed the feat in 62 days, helping cement his reputation as the ???Swiss Machine.???Steck said in an interview last month with Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger that he considered himself an ???outsider??? in the mountaineering scene because athletic achievement is more important to him than adventure.Asked about his upcoming Everest-Lhotse expedition, involving a quick climb from one peak to the other including an overnight in the death zone, Steck said: ???When I???m on Everest I can stop at any point. The risk is therefore quite small. For me it???s primarily a physical project.

Miller from close range with a virtual open net behind him.Miller, who has one assist and no goals in the playoffs, smacked his stick against the glass after he was denied.However, Chris Kreider ??? who made his Rangers debut during the 2012 first-round series against the Senators and also had been quiet in the playoffs ??? put his team ahead at 10 minutes 39 seconds off assists from Mika Zibanejad and Ryan McDonagh.Kreider shouted in delight as he celebrated his breakthrough moment along the boards.When he settled on the Rangers??? bench, Zibanejad, a former Senator, hugged him and planted a kiss on Kreider???s white helmet.Penguins 6, Capitals 2AP, WashingtonPhil Kessel scored twice, Sidney Crosby set up more goals and the Pittsburgh Penguins chased Braden Holtby on the way to a 6-2 victory over Washington Capitals in Game 2 that gave them a commanding 2-0 lead in their second-round series.Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 34 of the 36 shots he faced for Pittsburgh, which also got goals by Matt Cullen, Jake Guentzel and Evgeni Malkin.The Penguins scored three goals on 14 shots on Holtby, who was pulled in favor of Philipp Grubauer after the second period.",1

May told the BBC.May also reaffirmed her position that she would be prepared to walk away from the talks on leaving the EU without a deal if she did not like what was on offer from Brussels.At the Brussels summit, which was marked by unusual harmony among the 27 leaders, there was a flash of the cross-Channel acrimony which some fear could wreck any deal when officials accused London of cynically vetoing some EU spending and demanded it back down or face disrupting the start of talks next month.Meeting for the first time since May triggered the two-year countdown to Brexit in late March, her counterparts took just minutes as they sat down to lunch in Brussels to approve eight pages of negotiating guidelines hammered out by their diplomats over the past month.They greeted the decision with applause, officials said.The text will bind Michel Barnier, their chief negotiator, to seek a deal that secures the rights of 3 million EU expatriates living in Britain, ensures London pays tens of billions of euros Brussels thinks it will be owed, and avoids destabilizing peace by creating a hard EU-UK border across the island of Ireland.???We are ready,???

In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city???s federal plaza to Trump Tower.???We are here because there is no Planet B,??? the Reverend Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told a rally in Boston.The demonstrations came one week after supporters of science gathered in 600 cities around the globe, alarmed by political and public rejection of established research on topics including climate change and the safety of vaccines.Participants on Saturday said they object to Trump???s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things.Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame.Among those attending the Chicago rally were members of the union representing US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees.Trump has proposed cutting the EPA???s budget by almost one-third, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs.American Federation of Government Employees Council 238 president John O???Grady called the march ???a chance to speak out in unity against this administration??? and its ???ridiculous gutting of the EPA budget and staffing.???More than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe.???I???ve seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,??? lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine, said.People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood.Saharlah Farah, a 16-year old immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could have a bigger toll on marginalized groups that have less financial resources.???But I see untapped power here today,??? she said.A demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Florida, where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city.",1
223,World News,"Faced with exploding populations and steadily rising temperatures worldwide, cities must make haste in reinforcing defenses against climate change-induced flooding and heat waves, experts said last week.City temperatures are forecast to shoot up in the coming years, exposing inhabitants to killer heat spikes, while rising sea levels and river flooding threaten homes, drinking water, and transport and electricity infrastructure.Cities are vulnerable to a unique risk called the ???urban heat island??? (UHI) effect ??? their concrete surfaces retain more of the sun???s heat than undeveloped areas, scientists said at a meeting in Vienna of the European Geosciences Union (EGU).By midcentury, if planet-warming fossil fuel emissions continue unabated, city temperatures in Belgium could exceed today???s heat-alert levels by as much as 10?C for 25 days each summer, according to one research paper.Another study showed that heat waves will become a frequent challenge for European cities ??? more numerous in the south of the continent, more intense in the north.Floods, a major risk to Europe???s dense urban settlements, will become more common because of an increase in freak rainstorms, as well as sea-level increases caused by polar ice melt and warmer ocean water expanding.In flood-prone Southeast Asia, precipitation is set to increase by 20 percent this century, one researcher said in Vienna.The stakes are especially high given the projections for expansion of urban areas, which are often ill equipped to deal with nature???s vengeance.Already, more than half the world???s population live in cities. By 2050, 80 percent of people in rich nations, and 60 percent in developing states, will be concentrated in built-up areas, according to recent calculations.This corresponds to the appearance of a settlement of 1 million inhabitants somewhere on the globe every week for the next 40 years.Occupying only a small portion of Earth???s available land, cities are responsible for 80 percent of all energy consumed and generate more than 60 percent of the planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted when humans burn fossil fuel for heating, power and transportation.In spite of efforts to curb emissions, the planet has already warmed about 1?C on average from pre-Industrial Revolution levels.Many scientists say the planet may be on track for 3?C of warming or more, exceeding the 2?C cap politicians set in Paris in 2015.This means cities must act now to shore up their defenses against impacts that can no longer be avoided, French climatologist Herve le Treut said at the annual EGU gathering.???It???s already happening,??? Le Treut said of climate change impacts. ???We have to start structural action quickly: transportation, houses... mainly in the cities, especially in vulnerable places.???Most of the infrastructure constructed by humanity is in urban zones.???The ways cities are built is not optimal??? for today???s climate reality, said Daniel Schertzer, a hydrometeorologist at the engineering school Ecole des Ponts ParisTech.???Historically, humans have settled near water, thinking of its usefulness, but not of the risk! Cities were conceived without taking geophysics into consideration, now they are discovering that nature is complicated, not just good,??? he said on the sidelines of the conference.Paris, for example, is due for its next so-called one-in-a hundred-year flood. The last major Paris flood, in 1910, saw the Seine river rise 8.62m, shutting down much of the City of Light???s basic infrastructure.",1
224,World News,"A multimillion-dollar program of events in Hong Kong is to mark 20 years since the territory was handed back to China by colonial ruler Britain, but critics say the show is out of step with political tensions.The large-scale celebrations come despite increased concerns over Beijing meddling in the territory and deep political divisions between Hong Kong???s pro-democracy and pro-China camps.Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) is expected to visit for the July 1 anniversary, with security exercises under way in preparation.Hundreds of events, from art exhibitions to sports tournaments, will take place between now and the end of the year as part of the festivities, with the government proposing to spend HK$640 million (US$82 million).Colored lights and rainbow posters already adorn local neighborhoods under the slogan ???Together, Progress, Opportunity.???An official video of Canto pop stars performing a new song, Hong Kong, Our Home, is frequently broadcast on television networks.Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying (?¢F???¡Â??¡Ó) said the celebrations reflected the territory???s ???vision of tomorrow,??? and aimed to engage all residents.???The handover to me is historically significant and worth commemorating because Hong Kong is originally a part of China,??? a 51-year-old resident who gave his name as Michael said.Retiree Ah Yu, 76, agreed, saying that the anniversary is ???important for Hong Kong because we are all Chinese.???However, others were skeptical.???Are we celebrating the fact that we don???t have freedom and have no democracy???? 67-year-old Ales Li said. ???Why don???t they use all these resources to mend divisions????Some young residents said they felt the celebrations were simply a stunt.???It isn???t really helpful towards anyone,??? university student Miranda Yeung, 20, said. ???It???s a great publicity campaign and it looks very exciting for a tourist, but it doesn???t really mean that much.???Others said the amount of money being spent was a waste in a territory with a yawning wealth gap.Frustration over a lack of political reform despite mass pro-democracy protests in 2014 has led to the emergence of groups demanding self-determination for Hong Kong or even a full split from China.That has sparked a backlash from Beijing, with Chinese authorities intervening to effectively bar two democratically elected pro-independence lawmakers from taking up their seats in last year.There are also concerns Beijing is interfering in other areas.Some believe a visit to the territory by Xi ??? his first since coming to power in 2012 ??? could be incendiary in the current climate.???The angry people will become more angry,??? Yeung said.Hong Kong???s next leader Carrie Lam (???????????¢D) ??? hated by pro-democracy activists ??? will also be sworn in on July 1. She has vowed to heal divisions, but critics say the festivities are unlikely to help.Art works from the Louvre, Egyptian mummies from the British Museum and an exhibition from Beijing???s Palace Museum will be on show as part of the celebrations. Other events include jiansi tournament ??? a game where participants kick a shuttlecock about ??? and a performance by renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang (??????).Political analyst Willy Lam (?????????) of the University of Hong Kong said the festivities were a display for Beijing and a Xi visit would be a red rag to some activists.",1

228,Features,"Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, is launching a new online publication which will aim to fight fake news by pairing professional journalists with an army of volunteer community contributors.Wikitribune plans to pay for the reporters by raising money from a crowdfunding campaign.Wales intends to cover general issues, such as US and UK politics, through to specialist science and technology.Those who donate will become supporters, who in turn will have a say in which subjects and story threads the site focuses on. And Wales intends that the community of readers will fact-check and subedit published articles.Describing Wikitribune as ???news by the people and for the people,??? Wales said: ???This will be the first time that professional journalists and citizen journalists will work side-by-side as equals writing stories as they happen, editing them live as they develop, and at all times backed by a community checking and rechecking all facts.???Although the site is launching at the beginning of the UK general election campaign, Wales said the impetus for the project came from the US.???Someone I know convinced me to give Trump 100 days before making my mind up,??? he said, ???but then on day one Kellyanne Conway came out and said her ???alternative facts??? line. That was when I really decided to move forward.???If the fundraising campaign goes well, Wales hopes to be able to hire the site???s first journalists ???as soon as possible??? ??? perhaps before June 8, when Britons vote in the general election called by prime minister Theresa May.Like Wikipedia, Wales???s new project will be free to access. The publication is launched last month with a crowdfunding campaign pre-selling monthly ???support packages??? to fund the initial journalists. The first issue will follow soon after.The community contributors will play a key part in the new site, ensuring that the content of the articles are always supported by as much extra information shared with the readers as possible.They will be backed up by a presumption of transparency in the site???s reporting, with journalists sharing full transcripts, video and audio of interviews.He hopes that a combination of the distributed intelligence of Wikipedia and measured professional journalism driven by a business model ???that???s not about chasing clicks??? will lead to a news organization built from the ground up to combat fake news and political rabble-rousing.There is a third way, he said, between the two models ???of he said, she said faux neutrality, or having a Paul Dacre [editor of the Daily Mail] agenda and ramming things down our throats.???He added: ???If you take a look at Wikipedia, it???s noisy and not a perfect place, but for true fake news, there???s been almost no impact on the Wikipedia community.???The volunteers are experienced enough to know it???s nonsense, and have an ethos saying: ???No, we???re here for neutral facts???: that community knows it from the ground up.???Those contributors who also support the site financially will eventually be able to advise on the topics they want Wikitribune to explore, Wales said.???If you take as an example the bitcoin community, they???re a very active and obsessed community.???There???s a lot of news that comes out in the field, and I think they???d love to be able to raise money to hire a journalist and put them on the bitcoin/blockchain beat.???",1

US Representative Jim Jordan said on CNN, citing domestic spending obtained by Democrats and other issues. ???We told [voters] we were going to do a short-term spending bill that was going to come due at the end of April so that we could fight on these very issues, and now it looks like we???re not going to do that.???The measure is assured of winning bipartisan support in votes this week; the House and Senate have until midnight on Friday to pass the measure to avert a government shutdown.Democrats played a strong hand in the talks since their votes are needed to pass the bill, even though Republicans control both the White House and Congress. As a result, the measure does not look much different than the deal that could have been struck on former US president Barack Obama???s watch.",1
235,Front Page,"South Korean media yesterday warned of a ???Trump risk??? threatening the alliance between Washington and Seoul amid high tensions over North Korea???s weapons ambitions.The two nations are bound by a defense pact and 28,500 US troops are stationed in the South.However, US President Donald Trump has said that Seoul should pay for a ???billion-dollar??? US missile defense system being deployed in the South to guard against threats from the nuclear-armed North.He has also pushed for renegotiation of what he called a ???horrible??? bilateral free-trade pact that went into effect five years ago, calling it an ???unacceptable ... deal made by [then-US secretary of state] Hillary [Rodham Clinton].???The remarks stunned Seoul, with South Korean politicians immediately rejecting his push for payment for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery.???Trump???s mouth rattling Korea-US alliance??? a front-page headline in South Korea???s top-selling Chosun Ilbo said.???There are issues that are far more important than just money,??? the newspaper said in an editorial. ???If either country keeps reducing the alliance to the matter of money or the economy, it is bound to undermine basic trust.???Seoul needed to come up with ???various Plan Bs??? for the future, the paper said.Trump on Sunday told CBS that if the North carried out a sixth nuclear test, he ???would not be happy... And I can tell you also, I don???t believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.??????We???ll see??? whether that signified military action, said Trump, who also described North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a ???pretty smart cookie.???Seoul???s presidential office on Sunday said Trump???s national security adviser, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, had appeared to backtrack on THAAD, telling his South Korean counterpart by telephone that the US would bear the cost of the missile deployment as initially agreed.However, McMaster told Fox News Sunday that the ???last thing??? he would ever do was contradict the president, and that ???the relationship on THAAD, on our defense relationship going forward, will be renegotiated as it???s going to be with all of our allies.???The JoongAng Ilbo accused Trump???s administration of sending ???confusing and contradictory messages,??? creating a ???chaotic situation??? that dealt a ???huge blow??? to the bilateral alliance.???The US must be well aware of the pain and backlash Seoul has endured to push for the THAAD deployment,??? it added.The Dong-A Ilbo printed on its front page: ???Trump Risk... we need to come up with new strategy for Korea-US alliance.???Trump was pouring ???a barrage of verbal bombs??? on Seoul in a challenge to its next leader,  the paper said.???We hope that Trump will be more careful with his words,??? the Dong-A Ilbo said in an editorial. ???Who???s going to smile if our alliance is shaken?

236,Taiwan News,"Denying Taiwan the right to participate in this year???s World Health Assembly (WHA) would be ???a further insult to Taiwanese,??? Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lee (?????¡±???) said yesterday.Lee made the remark in response to a question by New Power Party Legislator Freddy Lim (?????????) at a meeting of the legislature???s Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee.The WHA is to meet in Geneva, Switzerland, from May 22 to 31.Taiwan first attended the WHA as an observer in 2009, a year after former president Ma Ying-jeou???s (?????¡Ó???) administration came to power, adopting a conciliatory policy toward Beijing.Since then, Taipei has sent a delegation to Geneva every year, but has not yet received an invitation to this month???s meeting.There are concerns that Beijing might try to block Taiwan???s participation to the WHA in light of strained cross-strait relations since President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) took office in May last year.Lim criticized the government for accepting an invitation to the assembly last year, because it included a reference to Beijing???s ???one China??? principle.???If China will not even allow us to attend the WHA, despite how much patience we have shown and how much we have swallowed our pride, then this goes to show that swallowing our pride does not win respect or goodwill,??? Lim said, calling on the government to consider pushing for a ???more normal and natural??? way of participating.The majority of Taiwanese do not understand why Beijing will not allow Taiwan to take part even as an observer in non-political organizations, such as the WHA, Lee said.If Beijing understood Taiwanese???s feelings, it would discard its old way of thinking and approach the issue with a new attitude, he said.The government has a backup plan in case it is not invited, Lee said, without providing details.The meeting???s main topic of discusion was the ???new framework??? for Taiwan-US relations approved by Tsai last month.The extensive vacancies related to East Asian Policy within the US executive branch is ???definitely a problem,??? Lee said, citing a member of a US-based think tank who said the US supports Taiwan???s participation in the WHA, but lacks officials to implement the policy.Numerous political appointments in the US Department of State, Department of Defense and Department of Commerce remain vacant several months into US President Donald Trump???s presidency, he said.???Right now we absolutely cannot find anyone who can hold talks with us,??? he said, adding that any talk of importing US pork or pushing for the ???new framework,??? aimed at increasing the frequency and level of official contact between Taiwan and the US, would have to wait until those vacancies are filled.",1
237,Taiwan News,"Reuters news agency has apologized to Taiwan over a misunderstanding stemming from last week???s interview with President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???), during which she was asked about the possibility of another telephone call with US President Donald Trump, Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lee (?????¡±???) said yesterday.In the interview, which was published on Thursday with the headline ???Taiwan president says phone call with Trump can take place again,??? Reuters quoted Tsai as saying that ???we don???t exclude the opportunity to call President Trump himself, but it depends on the needs of the situation and the US government???s consideration of regional affairs.???Trump, in a Reuters interview published on Friday with the headline ???Trump spurns Taiwan president???s suggestion of another phone call,??? said that he does not want to create problems for Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) when Beijing appears to be helping efforts to rein in North Korea???s nuclear and missile programs.Trump???s response has been described as a ???slap in the face??? to Tsai, and some Taiwanese have criticized the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which arranged the interview, as having poor judgement and allowing itself to be ???set up??? by the news agency.Some Democratic Progressive Party members accused Reuters of misinterpreting Tsai???s words, as she gave the interview in Mandarin, while others suggested that the agency had been bought off by China to set up Tsai???s apparent ???humiliation??? by Trump.In response to media queries, Lee said Reuters had submitted a list of questions in advance, but the one about a possible repeat of the telephone call between Tsai and Trump was not on the list.After the interview, Reuters expressed its regrets and apologized to the ministry, Lee said.He said Reuters officials told the ministry that they ???feel embarrassed,??? saying the agency???s Asian bureau was unaware its Washington bureau had scheduled an interview with Trump right after the one with Tsai.Asked about the matter during a legislative hearing, the minister said although the question was raised unexpectedly, Tsai???s answer was well-considered and circumspect.He said Washington was concerned over Tsai???s comment about the possibility of calling Trump until the ministry provided them with a full transcript of the interview.Tsai called Trump on Dec. 2 last year, less than a month after his election as US president, to offer her congratulations, the first known contact of its kind since the two nations severed diplomatic ties in 1979.",1
238,Taiwan News,"The Cabinet???s Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee is collecting information regarding the ties between the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Chinese Association for Relief and Ensuing Services (CARES), a committee spokeswoman said yesterday.CARES, which was a semi-government organization founded in 1950 to provide aid to Chinese political dissidents in exile as part of the KMT regime???s anti-communist campaign, was listed as an affiliate of the KMT by the Executive Yuan during former president Chen Shui-bian???s (????¢X????) administration.The Chinese-language Liberty Times (the Taipei Times??? sister newspaper) has reported that the committee would next investigate the association.CARES was funded with government subsidies, US financial aid and public donations, and it has transformed into an organization dedicated to disaster relief and the welfare of Chinese spouses, teenage Aborigines and senior citizens.CARES has been occupying 19 public properties in Taipei???s Xinyi District (??????) covering 1.27 hectares since 1975, with an estimated market value of NT$7.7 billion (US$254.8 million).Some of the properties have been turned into a kindergarten and a parking lot, generating a combined annual income of about NT$200 million.CARES was not asked to pay for using the properties until 2011.Committee spokeswoman Shih Chin-fang (?????????) confirmed that the committee is in the process of collecting evidence concerning the suspected link between the KMT and CARES.???The committee is evaluating the necessity of establishing a case against the CARES and other organizations that were implicated in the investigations conducted by [Chen???s] administration before 2008,??? Shih said.However, there is no immediate plan to conduct hearings to determine CARES??? status ??? a necessary step to make any formal recognition of the organization???s link with the KMT, she said.CARES??? use of state-owned properties should be handled by the National Property Administration, while the committee is responsible for illicitly acquired assets of political parties and their affiliates, she said.The CARES staff was allowed to combine their years of service in the organization and the government to qualify for pensions ??? a privilege given to members of the KMT and some organizations founded by the party ??? but that alone could not be used to substantiate a link between the KMT and CARES, Shih said.The committee???s priority in the second half of this year would be finalizing its investigations into Central Investment Co (??????????????????), Hsinyutai Co (??¢G?¢G???¢X), the National Women???s League, the China Youth Corps, Broadcasting Corp of China and Central Motion Picture Corp to determine their relationship to the KMT, she added.",1

Hsu quoted the father as saying, adding that the nation???s level of safety also contributed to the decision.Hsu said that in Hong Kong only about 25 percent of high-school graduates are accepted into universities, with most people studying overseas.Taiwanese universities offer students science faculties and multifaceted research opportunities, Hsu said, adding that Hong Kong???s science faculties are comparatively more traditional.Taiwanese universities have the advantage of being able to offer student accommodation given their larger campuses, he said, adding that larger campuses also means more space for equipment and research facilities.???Tuition here is less than a quarter of that in Hong Kong. HK$50,000 [US$6,428] is not enough to pay for one year of study in Hong Kong. In Taiwan, that is enough for four years of university,??? Hsu said. ???Some Taiwanese professors are so friendly that they have been known to have late-night snacks with students while they do research,??? he added.Hsu said studying in Taiwan could also open doors to other international education experiences for visiting students, citing changes in the nation???s university policies that recognize credits obtained elsewhere.There are 140 Taiwanese universities recruiting students in at fairs and via direct recruiting at more than 500 high schools in Hong Kong, he said.???Although Taiwan???s schools are facing an enrollment crisis caused by the aging population, there are recruitment opportunities elsewhere ??? not just in Hong Kong and Macau, but in Southeast Asia too,???

240,Taiwan News,"Minister Without Portfolio Audrey Tang (??????), a computer prodigy and entrepreneur who taught herself programming at age eight, says she is a ???civic hacker??? who, like a locksmith, uses specialized skills to help rather than harm.Appointed by leaders hoping to better connect with young voters who helped sweep President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) into office last year, 35-year-old Tang is using her expertise to more directly involve the public in policymaking and to counter ???fake news.??????Just by getting people to listen to the ideas that they don???t like, basically, develops their immune systems,??? Tang said last month in an interview while visiting Seoul for the annual Codegate international hacking competition.???If people have already considered carefully even the position of people they don???t agree with, they already have some kind of inoculation in their mind, so that they will not fall victim to rumors,??? she said.One of Tang???s initiatives is an artificial intelligence-powered system called Pol.is that aggregates and shares public views on policy issues to help determine the exact degree of support for a particular position.The government can use that data, for example, in negotiations over regulating Uber and other taxi services, Tang said.The approach reflects an effort to encourage deep thinking and listening on a mass scale, unlike the fragmented and ???half-baked??? ideas often found in social media posts, said Ming-Yeh Rawnsley, a research associate at the Centre of Taiwan Studies, SOAS, University of London.???It is important that [the] Taiwanese government is thinking about practicing deliberative democracy,??? Rawnsley said. ???While the explosion of social media platforms creates many exciting opportunities for public expression and mass participation, it also leads to a phenomenon where everyone wants to talk, but few care to listen.???Tang???s digital-friendly stance includes allowing top-level computer game players in the nation to serve an alternative form of compulsory military service. That gives professional e-sports League of Legends players the same opportunities an Olympics medalist would get.Next year, she plans to introduce classes on ???information technology and media literacy??? for all school years to help students learn to distinguish rumors and falsehoods from facts.???The idea is not about spotting ???fake news,??? but about being able to make decisions ... so that people don???t get swayed in one way or another based on rumors,??? Tang said.Taiwanese are keen on online forums like Twitter, whose 140-character limit for posts favors writing in Chinese characters that often can say more with fewer characters than in English.Tang objected to the term ???fake news,??? saying it is unfair to journalists.However, she said she finds US President Donald Trump???s enthusiastic use of Twitter ???refreshing.???Trump???s short declarations, though often surprising, leave little leeway for misinterpretation, she said.???If I make all my messages self-contained and short, then there???s no danger of being taken out of context. That???s the basic thing I???ve learned,???

I felt like I had no time to adjust the uniform. Players from other countries can wear the sports gear that they like when they compete in the Asian Championships, World Championships and the Olympics. Our players would likely feel more comfortable if they could do the same, rather than getting used to playing in a uniform that does not belong to them,??? she said.Tai said that she is scheduled to represent Taiwan in the Sudirman Cup later this month, which is a mixed team badminton championship.She said she is only asking for a uniform that fits, adding that all Taiwanese players should be allowed to wear clothing that fits well.This is not the first time Tai has had problems with her uniform for international games.The Chinese Taipei Badminton Association was criticized after last year???s Olympic Games in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, for threatening to fine Tai for not wearing the shoes provided by Yonex, the team???s official sponsor.The association congratulated Tai for being the first Taiwanese to win the Badminton Asia Championships title.It also said that it has asked the uniform sponsor to make customized outfits for Tai, adding that the sponsor should deliver the national team uniforms to athletes as soon as possible so that they have time to get used to or change their uniform.",1

Taoyuan outlet, as the hotelier seeks to increase its share of the banquet business.The company posted revenue of NT$374 million (US$12.38 million) in the first quarter, representing a 4.6 percent year-on-year increase.???The scale increase would allow FDC to raise its revenue at a faster pace from this quarter,??? company chairman Emile Sheng (?????????) told a news conference.FDC was spun off from L???Hotel de Chine Group (LDC, ???????¡±????), which owns Palais de Chine, Maison de Chine, Chateau de Chine, Chinatrust Hotels (????????????) and five more outlets in Italy.Sheng declined to comment on the cost of the acquisition, saying only that FDC would pay 3 percent of its revenue to its unlisted parent company, LDC, the actual buyer of the Splendor restaurant.Profit margins for banquet businesses are twice as high as that for other restaurants, explaining why the group is growing its banquet business despite intensive competition, FDC president David Ding (?????????) said.After taking over the food and beverage operation of Chateau de Chine???s Taoyuan outlet, FDC is to rename it the Taoyuan Mingsheng branch of Gala de Chine (????????¡±?¢G¡Â???), the banquet arm of FDC.In three months??? time, the Splendor restaurant is to be renamed the New Taipei Beixin branch of Gala De Chine, allowing the 15-year-old restaurant and customers some time to get used to the change.Under the arrangement, Gala De Chine, previously the sole banquet outlet in New Taipei City???s Sinjhuang District (??¢X???), has grown into a restaurant chain that also includes seafood buffet restaurant Giardino (?????¡Ó???).The banquet business is less vulnerable to economic cycle volatility and fluctuations in the number of foreign travelers, Ding said.Banquet operators need only to increase temporary staff during the high season and cut headcount in the low season, Ding said, adding that FDC has rehired almost all the employees Splendor laid off on April 30.Sheng attributed Splendor???s sale to family disputes and said he welcomed peers in similar situations to join FDC or LDC.LDC plans to launch a new outlet in Italy and has inked a contract with a Taiwanese partner to open a new property under Maison de Chine, Sheng said, refusing to elaborate.",1
253,Business,"Auto parts supplier Tsang Yow Industrial Co (???????¡Â??¢D?) yesterday said that it expects its revenue this quarter to grow more than 20 percent year-on-year, fueled by the fast-growing vehicle market in China.The company, which mainly makes automotive powertrain components, posted record-high sales of NT$813.8 million (US$26.93 million) in the first quarter, a surge of 29.11 percent from the same period last year, a company filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange showed.Tsang Yow???s sales growth momentum is likely to extend into this quarter, thanks to optimistic sentiment in China???s auto market, a company official said by telephone yesterday.In the first quarter, vehicle sales in China grew 7 percent on an annual basis to 7 million units, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.Driven by robust demand in China???s car market, the automotive parts maker said that since the fourth quarter of last year it has seen rising orders from its largest customer, Belgium-based Punch Powertrain NV.Punch Powertrain, a first-tier automotive components supplier, provides continuously variable transmissions for major Chinese companies including Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (???????¡Ó????) and BAIC Automotive Group (???????¡Ó????).The official, who declined to be named, said that revenue generated by the company???s Chinese subsidiary is expected to contribute 60 percent of total sales by the end of the year, and a monthly sales target of US$5 million has been set for its sales in China.???Last quarter was the first time that revenue from the Chinese subsidiary surpassed sales from our Chiayi plant,??? he said.The revenue contribution of its China-based plants was nearly 55 percent last quarter, while the Chiayi plant accounted for 45 percent over the period, company data showed.Apart from its core business of transmission components, Tsang Yow expects its compressors for automotive air-conditioning systems to be its next sales catalyst, saying that it began producing related parts for some Chinese customers at the beginning of the year.In related news, Tsang Yow???s local peer, Laster Tech Corp Ltd (???????¡±????), also reported record-high revenue for the first three months on the back of the booming China auto market.In the January-to-March period, Laster saw its sales skyrocket 50.4 percent year-on-year to NT$1.02 billion, benefiting from strong demand in China???s automotive LED lighting sector.Based in New Taipei City, Laster is the largest supplier of LED automotive lights in China.The company???s Chinese customers include Great Wall Motor Co (??¡P????¡Ó????), the largest sports utility vehicle brand in the Chinese market.",1
254,Business,"Chang Chieh-kuan (?????????), the owner of the last Chinese character letterpress and the last lead-character moldmaker in Taiwan, has long dreamed about passing on his work so that the dying technique of which he is a master practitioner can be preserved.However, just days before his humble shop, Rixing Type Foundry (??¢D????????????), squeezed into a small lane on Taipei???s Taiyuan Road (???????¡P¡Â), celebrated its 48th anniversary yesterday, 65-year-old Chang came to believe those hopes were a pipe dream and that it would be impossible to cultivate such talent.???I will just carve as long as I can,??? Chang said, as he strives to preserve the culture of Chinese letterpress printing against the passing of time and advent of new technology.Rixing Type Foundry is possibly home to the last remaining collection of traditional Chinese movable type character molds in the world. It possesses 120,000 molds of different characters in a wide range of sizes and three different typefaces ??? kai ti (?¢D¡P???) (regular script), song ti (??????) and hei ti (??????) (sans-serif black) ??? and has more than 10 million lead character pieces for printing or sale.The foundry also has several molding machines that allow it to fabricate 3D lead type pieces, making it the last and only foundry of its kind in Taiwan.However, the business might fade into history because many of its bronze molds are either partly or wholly worn.What makes the situation even more daunting, as Chang has long feared, is that there is no way to train anyone in the skills needed to repair bronze molds for lead type.It was in 1979 when Chang, a trained steel mechanic, started working at the lead foundry his father opened in 1969.Training in the crafting and mending of lead type bronze molds should really start at 12 or 13, because it takes 10 to 15 years to master the skills, he said.In addition, traditional masters remain at the peak of their abilities for about 10 years, at which point they have to rely more on experience as their eyesight deteriorates, Chang said.???These days it is impossible to acquire apprentices aged 12 or 13. If people come here after graduating from college or university, their eyesight is already not good enough to do the job,??? Chang said.Joking that he was ???forced??? to enter the business, the lead type foundry master said he now often spends most of the day at his desk, mending the worn molds.However, he said he never grows tired of the repetitive nature of tasks such as recrafting, scanning and correcting character types, which can seem extremely monotonous to an outsider. ???I do not know how long the bronze molds at Rixing will last, as many of them are already badly worn,??? Chang said. ???I am now 65 years old. It will take another 65 years to repair them all.???A skilled foundry master can mend a maximum of five character molds per day, he said, adding that to restore all 120,000 molds at Rixing Foundry would be extremely expensive.Despite the time-consuming and labor intensive nature of the work, Chang told visitors to his shop that lead type imbues Chinese characters with a grandeur that digital printing cannot replicate.It is like the difference between listening to music on vinyl or CD; it is all about the warm sentiment lead type conveys, he said.Early this year Rixing launched a type bronze mold restoration project in the hope that an online fundraising program would help raise the funds needed to preserve its endangered bronze molds so that they can be passed on in their entirety.",1
255,Business,"Taiwan???s notebook shipments in the first quarter rose 6.3 percent year-on-year, their first uptick since the final quarter of 2014, the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC, ??¢F?¢D??????¡Ó?????????) said on Friday.The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc???s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (??¡Ó??????) said.Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said.Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said.Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight  designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year???s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays.Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China.A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said.The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand.Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed.While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc???s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp???s Kraby Lake, the institute said.However, AMD???s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said.The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses.As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.",2

258,Business,"A state-owned Swedish company has become the latest European firm to enter Britain???s lucrative energy market, as the kingdom???s appeal to continental power suppliers shows no sign of abating after the Brexit vote.Vattenfall AB, which is 100 percent controlled by the Swedish government, is launching its first foray into British energy supply as it joins a competitive field of European players including  Electricite de France SA (EDF), German-owned E.ON SE, Npower Ltd and Spanish-backed ScottishPower Ltd.Vattenfall has already made inroads in Britain by building several wind farms, including a North Sea project near Aberdeen and Wales??? largest offshore wind farm which is due to complete next year.Now, in what Vattenfall has described as a vote of confidence in post-referendum Britain, the firm is to sell its renewable power from the wind farms direct to business customers.???Long term we don???t see that this [Brexit] as changing the basic prerequisite for doing business together. We find the UK to be an attractive market for us now and going forward, and we will continue to invest in the market,??? Vattenfall executive Anna Borg said.Vattenfall follows established European players such as EDF and E.ON, but also Danish state-owned Dong Energy A/S, which sells its wind power to corporate clients, and Dutch firm Eneco Holding NV, which supplies business customers such as Heineken NV and Unilever PLC.France???s Engie Group is also attempting to muscle in on the consumer market and trying to woo households with a tariff that tracks wholesale power prices.Borg said European power companies are attracted to the British market because of two fundamentals ??? tight margins between energy ??? and demand which means a constant appetite for new entrants and Britain???s legally enshrined climate targets, which are to remain when the kingdom leaves the EU and ensure demand for energy generated by renewables or nuclear.The combination, she said, means the government is supporting investment in new plants and requires energy from low-carbon entrants. Vattenfall believes its portfolio of renewable power and the confidence instilled by dealing with an established player would help it win over corporate customers wanting to burnish their green credentials.Borg said Vattenfall is a state-owned company which has been around for 100 years and is here to stay.Vattenfall???s decision to sell its German coal business last year to focus on green energy also showed it was capable of transforming, Borg added.While Vattenfall is not yet naming its first customers, it said it is in talks with British retailers, manufacturing industries and data center operators.Borg would not be drawn on whether the Swedish firm was considering making a play for the consumer market, which is dominated by six big energy suppliers, four of which are owned by European energy companies.???It???s too early to say. We will see what opportunities arise,??? she said.However, the prospect of price caps being imposed on household energy bills, as promised by Theresa May???s Conservative Party, would not deter Vattenfall.???In general of course, price regulation is complicated and difficult in a market that is supposed to be deregulated, but we are used to managing a lot of regulatory issues in all the markets we operate in, so it doesn???t change our willingness,???

261,Business,"Mass-media company 21st Century Fox Inc is in talks with Blackstone Group LP, the giant investment firm, to make an offer for Tribune Media and its stable of TV stations, people briefed on the negotiations said on Sunday night, a move that would potentially forestall a rival bid for Tribune.The move by Fox and Blackstone is aimed at not only bolstering Fox???s TV portfolio, but also beating an offer by Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc, the US??? biggest station operator, before a bidding deadline this week.The people briefed on the talks spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations are continuing.Under the terms of the potential arrangement, Blackstone would contribute cash to the venture, while 21st Century Fox, the huge entertainment company run by the Murdoch family, would contribute its 28 owned-and-operated stations.Representatives of 21st Century Fox and Blackstone declined to comment on their talks, which were reported earlier by Bloomberg News and the Financial Times.Tribune, which was formed when its parent company divided its TV and its print media holdings into two separate companies, owns 42 stations ??? and has the most Fox affiliates of any station owner. As of Friday, the company???s market value was about US$3.2 billion.The surge of interest in Tribune comes after the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last week decided to change regulations governing station ownership.The FCC???s move to reinstate the so-called ultra-high-frequency (UHF) discount ??? backed by the agency???s two Republican commissioners and opposed by its sole Democratic one ??? essentially loosened rules limiting how many stations a single operator could own, though companies are still forbidden to cover more than 39 percent of US households.The discount allowed broadcasters to include only half of their stations broadcasting on UHF toward ownership limits.Bringing back the discount, analysts have said, all but guarantees new efforts at consolidating the TV industry even further.Broadcasters, including Tribune, praised the FCC???s decision as one that lets them become more competitive with rival service providers such as cable and satellite companies.???Today???s action by the Federal Communications Commission is a welcome step toward creating a more level playing field for all local broadcasters in their relationships with TV networks, satellite operators, cable providers, and streaming video services,??? Tribune said in a statement last week.The expected return of the UHF discount under US President Donald Trump???s administration was what led companies such as Sinclair, which has 173 stations, and Fox to weigh bids for Tribune. Other broadcasters are said to be considering takeover offers for Tribune as well.FCC chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, has hinted that he is open to further deregulation of TV station ownership.For Fox, blocking Sinclair???s bid for Tribune would eliminate the creation of a more formidable opponent when negotiations for broadcasting fees occur.Fox, embattled by sexual harassment scandals at its Fox News cable network, has been working to shore up its TV empire in other ways. It is waiting for British regulatory approval to buy full control of Sky, the British satellite TV giant in which it owns a 39 percent stake.Two weeks ago, that pursuit was delayed by the British communications regulator as it continues to review whether the combined company would be ???fit and proper??? to hold a broadcasting license.",1

The banking association calculates Sweden will have amassed 222 billion kronor (US$25.11 billion at current exchange rates) to deal with troubled lenders by 2032.That is 10 times more than it would have had if Sweden had used standard EU bank union rules.The Swedish government has said that it needs to create additional safeguards to protect taxpayers from a financial system that is about four times the size of the economy.If Nordea were to move to Denmark, the country???s regulator would be responsible for bank assets that would be more than five times the country???s GDP.

265,Editorials,"A media interview can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it gives politicians a chance to explain their views; on the other hand, it can sometimes backfire and have the opposite effect. President Tsai Ing-wen???s (?????¡Ó???) interview with Reuters on Thursday has turned out to be an example of the latter.This was not due to any mistake by Tsai; instead, it was Reuters??? doing. There was nothing inappropriate or wrong in Tsai???s responses to the reporters??? questions. Always cautious, Tsai gave appropriate and concrete answers to their questions. She was forthcoming and direct, and displayed the views and bearing becoming of a president.She was not overbearing on the issue of relations between Taiwan, the US and China, and she gave voice to a Taiwanese identity without deliberately fawning on either the US or China. In short, her behavior was presidential and praiseworthy.The problem was the reporters??? hypothetical line of questioning.For example, the reporters asked Tsai: ???Will you hold further conversations with [US] President [Donald] Trump? Are you expecting to???????We are of course hoping that we will have the opportunity to communicate directly with the US government at critical moments and on critical issues, and do not rule out the opportunity for another telephone conversation with President Trump himself, but this will be dependent on the overall situation and on the US government???s concerns when it comes to handling the affairs of this region,??? Tsai said.This is both a balanced and relevant answer.However, the headline Reuters gave the report was: ???Exclusive: Taiwan president says phone call with Trump can take place again,??? and a Reuters reporter immediately asked Trump if he would call Tsai again.Trump, unaware of the interview with Tsai, brushed the question aside and said that he was addressing the North Korea issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????), and that he did not want to irritate Beijing with any other issues.Trump???s response was reasonable: North Korea is the issue that the US most urgently needs to resolve and it needs China???s help to do so.Another question posed by Reuters was: ???Will you directly rule out purchasing F-35 jets???????Our military purchases will be directed by our defense strategy needs, and we don???t rule out any item that would be meaningful to our strategy. The F-35 is indeed one such item,??? Tsai said.A Reuters reporter directly asked Trump whether the US would sell F-35s to Taiwan, since Taiwan wants to buy them. Trump said that he had not been notified, that he needed to think about it and that he had to confer with his team.Reuters??? handling of the report gave the impression that Tsai had suggested that a second telephone conversation with Trump should be organized, and that Trump had rejected the suggestion. However, the Chinese transcript of the interview on the Presidential Office???s Web site shows that Tsai only responded to the Reuters reporter???s question by saying that it would depend on the US government???s considerations, and that there were currently no such plans on either side.The purchase of F-35 jets is also a hypothetical issue that lacks any substance.Reuters had a great opportunity to interview Tsai, and several important issues were discussed during the interview. Too bad that all the good points have been drowned out by the furor over two non-issues.",1
266,Editorials,"The world that we live in is far different from that which experienced the Cold War mentality and ideological struggles at the end of World War II. At that time, the Allied powers had defeated the Axis alliance, and a new struggle appeared between communism and democracy.Ironically, however, even as that ideological struggle emerged, it was itself being subtly questioned in George Orwell???s Animal Farm. One of the basic points that Orwell was making and which is often lost in the allegory is that at the end of the story, the other farm animals found it difficult to distinguish between their previous capitalist rulers and the pigs that replaced them.This insight is what makes Thomas Piketty???s Capital in the Twenty-First Century all the more intriguing and worth re-examining from at least two perspectives. First is how capitalism, which contains many destructive seeds of humanity, can span ideology, and second, the highly important and slowly realized attention that this places on the burgeoning democracy of Taiwan.Piketty???s main thesis treats the growing problem of wealth and income inequality, which he found in Europe and the US since the 18th century, and how it threatens democracy.What Piketty does not delve into are those countries allegedly fashioned by Marxist communism, where the same wealth gaps and disparity hold true as well. Age-old desires for power and control remain the sought-after ends and unchecked capitalism has quickly supported this by creating new oligarchies in Russia and China.These two nations, along with the US, are the top three countries with the largest number of billionaires. The families and princelings of oligarchs have replaced the families of the czars and emperors in Russia and China.On the US side, capitalism appears to be returning to the past days of the robber barons. In short, oligarchies are becoming the new bloodlines of inherited power and the new despotism; this is a point that fits Orwell???s allegory.Unfortunately, oligarchies and privilege are the same the world over. A different book by business journalist Duff McDonald, The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and its Secret Influence on American Business, shows how this firm has become the ???godfather of CEO megapay??? in a leading democracy.This contributed to the new phrase: ???We are the 99 percent.???The truth of this slogan is increasingly becoming real. One can argue with Piketty over the means of determining wage gaps, but one does not need to be a rocket scientist to see the disparity in a country where its Congress and state electors argue over a minimum wage of US$15 for average citizens while CEO pay has skyrocketed to 500 times that of ordinary workers. This is the new ???Animal Farm.???Who can tame the new pigs? Transparency and a free press are essential to this and often lacking even in the US where the growing consciousness of the meaning and implications of who the ???99 percent??? are is taking hold.Transparency, transparency, transparency. For US citizens, those who put their faith in the blustering and boasting promises of US President Donald Trump, history states that they are asking to be disillusioned. There is a weasel quality about a man who now even seeks to hide who visits him in the White House and who refuses to honor his promise to show his tax returns.",1

They even broke two of Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan???s (?????????) ribs and then accused him of pretending to be injured.Of course, no one was willing to take responsibility for the action. This violates the principle of love and non-violent protest, which means demonstrators can use their bodies to promote their demands and public interests, but not harm innocent people.While the rallies called for the supervision of reforms, they were entirely aimed at protecting the private interests of the protesters.On April 19, lawmakers yielded and agreed to hold two more public hearings, although public hearings and preparations for the national congress on pension reform have been under way for a full year.These people continue to cause social costs with the sole purpose of highlighting and prolonging the focus on their demands.Moreover, the actions of the so-called ???800 heroes??? looked as if they were rallying in support of a certain Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) chairperson candidate.Meanwhile, Chang An-lo (?????????) ??? or the ???White Wolf???

That minimum for civil servants is the maximum that an ordinary private employee would receive.",1
268,Editorials,"President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) has announced that a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system is to be built in Changhua County. With every city and county demanding an MRT or light-rail system, Tainan, Hsinchu, Keelung and Changhua are next in line to join Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taoyuan and Taichung. This development is no different from the 1990s policy to open many new universities, which has resulted in a higher education crisis.People who have traveled on the Taipei MRT are surely impressed by its convenience and the crowds. It seems that having an MRT is the symbol of a fashionable city. Having experienced the ???convenience??? and seen the ???profits??? made by its operator, Taipei Rapid Transit Corp, city mayors and county commissioners across the nation want to emulate this success.However, the Taipei MRT???s 20-year history shows that although the average number of people using the system last year exceeded 2 million per day, the transportation side of the business was still losing money. Had it not been for other sources of revenue, such as advertising and rent, there would not have been enough money to cover the system???s operating costs.Taipei and New Taipei City have a population of more than 6.5 million, and combined with tourists and business visitors, these people account for the average daily transport volume of more than 2 million passengers.Kaohsiung has a population of less than 3 million, and after 10 years in operation, the transportation side of its MRT business is still losing money. Let us not even mention Changhua County, with a population of less than 1.3 million. If local populations continue to grow, it might make sense, but are not all Taiwanese feeling the pressure of the nation???s low birthrate?Those who want to use transportation infrastructure to bolster the local economy might have mistakenly simplified the relationship between cause and effect. Transportation infrastructure is indeed an important component of economic development, but it is not certain to create economic development. Other key components are an available workforce and a conducive industrial environment.Transportation infrastructure alone without supporting measures run the risk of resulting in an empty and unused MRT system.Yang Chih-yuan is an assistant professor at National Taiwan Normal University.Translated by Lin Lee-Kai",1

Thomas said of his second flight to Washington in two weeks. ???It???s tough, but it???s the playoffs, so there are no excuses. I decided to play and I just tried to give it all for my team.???The Celtics star flew to the funeral with Boston president of basketball operations Danny Ainge and assistant coach Jerome Allen.During player introductions, Thomas pointed to the TD Garden rafters when his name was called.Al Horford added 21 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. Jae Crowder finished with career playoff-high 24 points.Game 2 is scheduled for today.The Wizards were more energetic at the outset, jumping out to a 16-0 advantage and leading by as many as 17 points, but the Celtics rallied with Thomas briefly sidelined while getting his tooth repositioned in the second quarter.???I didn???t know if we???d ever score and I didn???t know if they???ve ever stop scoring,??? Celtics coach Brad Stevens said.Bradley Beal led Washington with 27 points, while John Wall added 20 points and 16 assists.Washington starter Markieff Morris played just 11 minutes before leaving with a sprained left ankle in the second quarter after landing awkwardly on Horford???s foot.The Wizards also had a tough time responding after Stevens started Marcus Smart in place of Gerald Green in the third quarter.???They were a little more aggressive than we were,??? Beal said. ???Our defense slipped a little. We lacked some IQ and focus.???After the Wizards??? early scoring flurry, Thomas lost his tooth, but initially kept playing.He found it during a timeout and started the second quarter in the locker room.His teammates went on a 13-2 run without him to cut into Washington???s lead.

277,World News,"A US-based human rights group says US President Donald Trump should seek accountability and not offer to roll out the White House red carpet for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who the group accuses of being a mass murder ???mastermind??? amid the thousands of deaths in his crackdown against drugs.Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other critics yesterday reacted with alarm and outrage at Trump???s invitation for Duterte to visit the White House in a telephone call where the Trump also affirmed the US??? treaty alliance and friendship with the Philippines and its new president, who has had an antagonistic stance toward US security policies.Left-wing Philippine group Bayan urged Duterte to reject Trump???s invitation, saying the visit would not change what it said was the US??? lopsided relations with its former colony.???It may provide an interesting photo op, but nothing more,??? Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said.The US and other nations close to the Philippines ???have an obligation to urge accountability for the victims of Duterte???s abusive drug war, rather than offer to roll out the red carpet for official state visits with its mastermind,??? HRW deputy director for Asia Phelim Kine said.Kine said separately in an e-mailed response to questions from the AP that Trump might be undertaking action inimical to human rights by adopting an overly friendly overture to Duterte, who is facing a complaint for alleged mass murder before the International Criminal Court.???Trump should recognize that he has cut a bad deal for the people of both the United States and the Philippines if he rolls out the red carpet for a Duterte visit without carefully weighing the implications of hosting and toasting a foreign leader whose links to possible crimes against humanity for instigating and inciting extrajudicial killings has already prompted warnings from the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court,??? he said.Duterte has said in the past that his administration did not have a policy backing extrajudicial killings, although he has repeatedly threatened drug suspects with death and unusual violence in his nationally televised speeches.Duterte???s spokesman Ernie Abella did not immediately reply to a request for reaction to HRW???s statement.The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said Duterte has not yet responded to Trump???s offer, adding that an official US invitation would kick off diplomatic arrangements for Duterte???s possible US trip.If Duterte accepts, the trip might happen soon because of the urgent topic, department spokesman Robespierre Bolivar told reporters.???The US apparently wants to consult allies and strategic partners in Asia to discuss an approach to the tensions over DPRK [Democratic People???s Republic of Korea],??? Bolivar said.???The discussion that transpired between the presidents was warm, with President Trump expressing his understanding and appreciation of the challenges facing the Philippine president, especially on the matter of dangerous drugs,??? Abella said in a statement.A White House statement described the call late on Saturday as ???very friendly??? and said the US-Philippine alliance ???is now heading in a very positive direction.???White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said the friendlier ties are needed even with concerns about Duterte???s human rights record, which includes extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers and users as part of the government???s drug war, citing the military threat of North Korea.",1
278,World News,"Thailand???s junta chief has accepted an invitation to visit the White House from US President Donald Trump, his spokesman said yesterday, the latest autocrat to be embraced by the US leader.The offer came during a telephone conversation on Sunday night, part of a flurry of calls Trump made to Southeast Asian leaders over the weekend trying to shore up regional support over the troubled Korean peninsula.He on Sunday extended a White House invitation to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal campaign against drugs has claimed thousands of lives and led to warnings from rights groups about possible crimes against humanity.???The Prime Minister thanked and accepted President Trump???s invitation to visit the United States,??? junta spokesman Major General Werachon Sukhonhapatipak said in a statement, adding that the offer to visit had been reciprocated by Bangkok.Thailand???s former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power three years ago, anointing himself prime minister and ushering in the kingdom???s most autocratic government in a generation.The coup strained ties with the former US president Barack Obama administration as the military jailed dissidents, banned protests and ramped up prosecutions under its draconian lese-majeste law.However, the generals who now run Thailand ??? a former staunch US ally that has moved closer to Beijing since the coup ??? know they are now less likely to be berated for their dismal rights record under Trump, who has had much fewer qualms about embracing autocrats.He also called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to congratulate him on winning a controversial referendum that would dramatically increase his powers, and Trump???s rhetoric towards China, a popular punching bag during the campaign, has noticeably softened since his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) in Florida last month.Many Southeast Asian nations have looked to the Trump administration with some trepidation.He has shown little appetite for Obama???s Asia ???pivot??? and he swiftly scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal after taking office.Trump is due to visit two regional summits ??? in Vietnam and the Philippines ??? toward the end of the year.The Thai junta statement was light on specifics, but said Trump ???had confidence in the Thai government??? and that the two nations were ready to ???enhance bilateral cooperation in all dimensions.???Like Trump, the arch-royalist general Prayut enjoys berating the media and speaking off the cuff at length, including during weekly ???Bringing Happiness Back to Thailand??? speeches that are broadcast on all channels.",1
279,World News,"They might not have lost themselves in the music or the moment, but a judge and nine lawyers in a New Zealand courtroom did listen politely to Eminem???s Lose Yourself as a copyright trial involving the nation???s ruling political party began yesterday.The Detroit-based music publishers for Eminem are suing New Zealand???s conservative National Party, alleging the soundtrack for a 2014 election campaign ad copied the rapper???s acclaimed 2002 song. Titled Eminem Esque, the track has the familiar urgent, pulsing beat of the original.The party has previously said it purchased the track through an Australian-based supplier and does not believe it has infringed anyone???s copyright.When the case was filed in 2014, New Zealand Representative Steven Joyce said he thought the use of the song was ???pretty legal,??? and that Eminem???s team ???are just having a crack and a bit of an eye for the main chance because it???s an election campaign.???That response was widely ridiculed, including by comedian John Oliver on his show Last Week Tonight.???Pretty legal? That???s not a concept that exists. That???s like being sort-of dead,??? Oliver said.Spokespeople for both Joyce and the National Party yesterday said they would not be commenting while the case was before the court.Garry Williams, the lawyer for Eminem???s music publisher Eight Mile Style, told the New Zealand High Court in Wellington that the National Party had wanted a song that was edgy and modern, but showed the party was dependable. He said the music fared better with focus groups than a classical piece.He quoted from National Party e-mails, including one in which the song is described as an Eminem ???sound-alike??? and another in which an agent for the party wrote: ???I guess the question we???re asking, if everyone thinks it???s Eminem, and it???s listed as Eminem Esque, how can we be confident that Eminem doesn???t say we???re ripping him off????Williams said the e-mails showed it was ???utterly clear??? the party knew it was using a copyrighted song.Speaking outside the court, spokesman for Eminem???s music publishers Joel Martin said he was surprised the two sides had not settled and that going to trial against an entity like a governing political party was unusual and extraordinary.???The bottom line is we would never have permitted the use of the song in any political advertisement,??? he said.Martin said the publishers are seeking both a cash settlement for an undisclosed amount and an acknowledgment by the court that the National Party breached copyright.He said that by pursuing the case, they are showing they take copyright infringement around the world seriously.He said the political views of the National Party were not a factor: ???We are Americans and we don???t know about politics in New Zealand,??? he said.Judge Helen Cull ruled that some details in the case would remain confidential because they were commercially sensitive.The judge-only case is expected to last about six days and will determine whether copyright was breached. The amount of any damages would be decided later.",1
280,World News,"In a wide-ranging news conference yesterday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra???ad al-Hussein voiced concern over developments in Turkey, Egypt, the Philippines, Yemen and several other nations.It is ???highly unlikely??? Turkey followed due process in the mass arrests and firings since the failed coup in July last year, Zeid said, before going on to specifically condemning the dismissals on Saturday.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan???s government on Saturday dismissed nearly 4,000 public officials, including more than 1,000 people working for the Ministry of Justice.???With such a large number, it is highly unlikely these suspensions and detentions will have met due process standards,??? Zeid said, referring to fired officials and the wider nine-month crackdown.He also said he was ???very concerned about the renewed state of emergency,??? which Turkey extended by parliamentary vote on April 18, saying the decision was made amid ???a climate of fear in the country.??????Journalism is not a crime in Turkey, it is an issue the government must pay deep attention to,??? he added.Turning to Egypt, he said that the heavy-handed security measures by the government were fostering the very radicalization it is looking to curb.Zeid condemned the attacks on two Christian churches last month Islamic State group suicide bombers that killed 45 people, which led the government to declare a three-month state of emergency hours later.???A state of emergency, the massive numbers of detentions, reports of torture and continued arbitrary arrests ??? all of this we believe facilitates radicalization in prisons,??? Zeid said. ???Abetted by the crackdown on civil society through travel bans, freezing orders, anti-protest laws, this is in our opinion is not the way to fight terror.??????National security yes, must be a priority for every country, but again not at the expense of human rights,??? Zeid said.He also said that he hoped US President Donald Trump would convey to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte the deep sense of alarm about Duterte???s apparent shirking of his duty to prosecute human rights violations, when the two men meet in Washington.The UN is also continuing to receive signals that the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen could attack the port of Hodeidah, causing humanitarian suffering and loss of life, Zeid said.???The UN is concerned about the humanitarian repercussions of such an attack in terms of inflaming the humanitarian crisis even further, let alone our concerns about loss of civilian life were there to be a large-scale attack on port,??? he said.",1
281,World News,"The US and its African allies have called off their hunt for Joseph Kony, one of the world???s most wanted fugitives, who is blamed for the deaths of at least 100,000 people and the suffering of millions more in central Africa.Kony leads the Lord???s Resistance Army (LRA) and has a US$5 million price on his head. He was one of the first people the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague indicted for crimes against humanity.About 150 US Special Forces soldiers and more than 1,500 Ugandan troops have been hunting Kony for almost a decade across a swath of remote forest and brush along the borders of the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan.The 56-year-old is believed to be moving with between 20 and 30 loyal fighters, several wives, his two sons and hundreds of followers.Many analysts believe he is hiding in the disputed, mineral-rich area of Kafia Kingi in South Darfur, Sudan, from where he and his sons can organize smuggling operations undetected.Other groups loyal to the LRA, which Kony founded nearly 30 years ago, are scattered across central Africa.Ugandan troops earlier last month began leaving the Central African Republic. The US Special Forces, deployed as part of a billion-dollar mission to kill or capture Kony, have also begun to withdraw. Officials and senior soldiers in both Uganda and the US say the LRA is no longer a threat.???The mission to neutralize the LRA has now been successfully achieved,??? the Ugandan army said in a statement.Analysts say Kony and the LRA are a shadow of the threat they were 10 or even 20 years ago, when they could deploy thousands of fighters and terrorized wide areas of central Africa.???The LRA has been in survival mode for some time,??? said Ben Shepherd, an expert in central Africa at London???s Chatham House think tank.Pamela Faber at the Center for Naval Analyses in Washington said the group, which is much diminished by defections, internal purges and battle casualties, was a vestige of its former self.However, many say the LRA ??? known for atrocious brutality against civilians including mass abductions and rapes, executions and torture ??? could still cause serious harm.Norbert Mao, an opposition politician and former chairman of Gulu district in northern Uganda, where the group emerged in the 1980s, said the withdrawal of troops gave it a chance to regroup.???Now that the Uganda government is stopping the search for LRA, it might become a mercenary force that can be used by any other groups to terrorize civilians. They will be soldiers of fortune and that???s a threat to the region,??? he said.Kony is now unlikely to appear before the ICC, but the trial of Dominic Ongwen, one of his key lieutenants, started earlier this year. It has revealed appalling details of the LRA???s atrocities.The charges against Ongwen include murder, attempted murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, conscription of children under the age of 15 into an armed group and, for the first time, ???forced pregnancy??? and forced marriage.The group has been blamed for the deaths of about 100,000 people and the abduction of 60,000 children.Former LRA abductees say they were forced to maim and kill friends, neighbors and relatives, and participate in gruesome rites such as drinking their victims??? blood. Ongwen himself was abducted by the LRA when still a teenager.",1
282,World News,"Nepal???s faltering democratic transition has been thrown into turmoil by a clash between the Himalayan nation???s Maoist-led government and the head of the Supreme Court that could derail this month???s local elections.The impoverished state is nearing the finish line of a decade-long effort to overcome the aftermath of an insurgency and fall of its monarchy that would culminate in a general election later this year.The interim step of holding the first local elections in two decades, scheduled for this month and next, is now in doubt after a top minister in charge of overseeing security for the vote quit his post on Sunday.Analysts say the resignation of Nepalese Deputy Prime Minister Bimalendra Nidhi could increase instability and one of the parties in the seven-party coalition government could walk out as a result.???The local elections are in doubt because of the resignation,??? said Kunda Dixit, editor of the Nepali Times weekly.The trigger for Nidhi???s resignation was a clash over a decision by Nepal???s first woman chief justice, Sushila Karki, to overturn the government???s appointment of a new national police chief two months ago.The two main parties in the coalition filed an impeachment motion against Karki on Sunday. She has been suspended pending impeachment proceedings, officials said.???She has interfered into the domains of the executive and must be removed,??? Nepali Congress lawmaker Chin Kaji Shrestha said.The Nepali Congress is the largest coalition member.Karki???s supporters say she has taken a strong stance against corruption during her time as head of the Supreme Court.A committee will be established to investigate the allegations of bias, after which parliament will vote on whether to impeach her.However, the process is unlikely to get that far as she is due to retire next month when she turns 65.Analysts say the move to unseat a judge known for delivering judgments free of the influence of politics or personal ties was an attack on the independence of judiciary.It has raised the danger of the parliamentary majority being used against constitutional bodies that do not obey political leaders,??? constitutional expert Bipin Adhikari said.Nepal has set elections to 744 village and municipal councils for May 14 and June 14.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the third-largest group in the coalition, was due to meet yesterday to consider whether to remain in the coalition if the impeachment motion is not withdrawn.Additional reporting by AFP",1

284,World News,"A global slime-making craze sparked by social media has prompted safety concerns over the use of the cleaning product borax.Also known as sodium borate, borax has a range of household uses including as an insecticide, a stain remover and a deodorizer. It is also a pivotal ingredient of home-made slime, a perennial art or science project in which it is mixed with water, glue and food coloring.Slime has recently undergone a global resurgence, with Google searches climbing steadily in the past 12 months and accelerating this year.In February, Elmer???s Glue said an increase in sales in the US in the second half of last year were ???due in large part to slime mania??? and, in March, the Today show reported that schools around the US had banned slime for being ???too distracting??? and messy.Borax, a naturally occurring mineral, is also a mild irritant and there have been concerns over children???s safety following reports of it inducing burns.An 11-year-old girl in Rockland, Massachusetts, suffered second and third-degree burns to her hands that were attributed to prolonged exposure to borax after making slime every day for several months.???I love it, a lot,??? the girl told local news media of slime in March. ???Don???t make it, don???t play with it.???In February, a Manchester, England, woman posted photographss of chemical burns on her daughter???s hands on Facebook as a warning to other parents. It was shared 820 times.???My little Queen has been making slime off YouTube ... 3 weeks later we are looking at plastic surgery on her hands from a burns department at Hospital,??? she wrote.According to the non-profit, non-partisan Environmental Working Group in the US, borax can have short and long-term health effects, with irritation possible following skin or eye contact, inhalation or ingestion.In the long term, it may disrupt hormones and harm the male reproductive system, with chronic exposure to high doses of borax linked to a greater risk of decreased sperm count and libido.Kate Copping of Melbourne told Guardian Australia that her 10-year-old daughter, Daisy, started making slime about six months ago after having come across it on YouTube.???She has been making it nonstop. We are going to buy glue constantly,??? Copping said.Copping said borax was ???kind of like a poison,??? but said nothing had worked so well to produce high-quality slime.Copping said the craze was popular among Daisy???s school friends, but she realized it was a worldwide phenomenon only after she vented her frustration with the messy fad on Facebook.???I???ve got a friend in Scotland who???s like ???I???m so sick of it, friends in the US saying the same thing ??? it???s going crazy everywhere,??? she said. ???I???ve heard at some schools, kids are making it and selling it in the playground.???The craze has been facilitated by social media, with 4.2 million results for ???slime tutorial??? on YouTube.

285,World News,"Chaz Wing was 12 when they cornered him in the school bathroom. The students who tormented him were children, too, entering the age of pimples and cracking voices.Eventually, he swore under oath, the boys raped him and left him bleeding, the culmination of a year of harassment.Though Wing repeatedly told teachers and administrators about the insults and physical attacks, he did not report being sexually assaulted until a year later, launching a long legal fight over whether his school had done enough to protect him.Wing???s saga is more than a tale of escalating bullying. Across the US, thousands of students have been sexually assaulted by other students, in high schools, junior-highs and even elementary schools ??? a hidden horror educators have long been warned not to ignore.Relying on state education records, supplemented by federal crime data, a year-long investigation by The Associated Press (AP) uncovered about 17,000 official reports of sex assaults by students over a four-year period, from fall 2011 to spring 2015.That figure represents the most complete tally yet of sexual assault among the US??? 50 million students in grades K-12.However, it also does not fully capture the problem: Such attacks are greatly under-reported, some states do not track them, and those that do vary widely in how they classify and catalog sexual violence.REPUTATIONS AT STAKEWith school reputations and funding at stake, there is tremendous pressure to hide such violence. Even under varying state laws, acknowledging an incident can trigger liabilities and requirements to act.???No principal wants their school to be the rape school,??? said Bill Howe, a former teacher who spent 17 years overseeing Connecticut???s compliance with a federal law that helps protect student victims of at-school sexual assault. ???It???s the courageous principal that does the right thing.???The attacks AP tracked ranged from rape and sodomy to forced oral sex and fondling.Assaults occurred anywhere students were left unsupervised: buses and bathrooms, hallways and locker rooms. No type of school was immune, whether it be in a wealthy suburb, inner city or farm town, and all types of children were targeted.Children remained most vulnerable to peer-on-peer sexual assault in the privacy of a home, the analysis of the federal crime data showed.However, schools were the No. 2 place where they were sexually violated by other children.INCIDENTS JUMP AT AGE 10About 5 percent of reported attacks involved five and six-year-olds. Incidents jumped between ages 10 and 11 ??? typically the start of middle school ??? and continued rising until age 14, when they began dropping as students progressed through high school.Unwanted fondling was the most common form of assault and about one in five of the abused kids were penetrated in some way.The data also showed sexual assaults by peers were more common than those by teachers, which receive far more attention. For every adult-on-child sexual attack reported at school, there were seven by students.???Schools are required to keep students safe,??? said Charol Shakeshaft, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who specializes in school sexual misconduct. ???It is part of their mission. It is part of their legal responsibility. It isn???t happening. Why don???t we know more about it and why isn???t it being stopped????",1

287,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

(RSF) new Taipei-based Asia bureau says. ???When I???m writing a press release, I won???t be trying to balance between, say, [Hong Kong???s] freedom fighters and the Chinese government. I???m making a choice, because in the matters we are dealing with, not making a choice is already giving in to the strongest.???Alviani, who has lived in Taiwan for 17 years, says he jumped at the opportunity when he heard that the Paris-based press freedom watchdog was planning to open its first Asia bureau. A graduate of the University of Strasbourg???s School of Journalism, Alviani worked for a regional newspaper for two years before moving to Thailand to work for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of his military service.The job later brought him to Taiwan, where he cofounded Infine Communications, which focuses on project management and consulting for various cultural activities. He also started the Taiwan European Film Festival and served as director of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry.???I don???t see it as a job,??? he says of his new gig. ???I had a job. This is a mission.???A SAFE DISTANCEAlviani says he was involved in the decision to set up RSF???s office in Taipei instead of Hong Kong, which has seen its press freedom ranking plummet in the past five years. The culprit is China, he says, which censors anything sensitive to the government and flexes its muscles to influence other governments and private businesses.???China is stressing the fact that you can have freedom of information with limitations,??? he says. ???That???s something we don???t agree with. Freedom is something that you either have or you don???t.???Alviani says since Hong Kong is one of the most crucial areas in his bureau???s battle for press freedom, he didn???t feel safe setting up office there.???It???s not always a good idea to build your headquarters on the frontlines,??? he says. ???We would be worried that our team could face intimidation, our communications might be under surveillance, and after a couple of months or years we might be asked to leave.???Although the office is located in Taipei, Taiwan won???t be a priority for the bureau as it boasts the most liberal press in Asia. While the focus will be on China, Hong Kong and North Korea, Alviani says that they will remain critical of Taiwan???s media environment as well as that of other democracies such as South Korea and Japan.He adds that Taiwanese authorities shouldn???t be satisfied with being first in Asia.???I wish Taiwan wasn???t the best in the area (while keeping the same score), because there are still things to improve on here,??? he says. ???We don???t want to say everything is great ??? but Taiwan is still moving in a good direction while other Asian countries are not.???SPREADING THE WORDAlviani says his first priorities are to develop a network of correspondents in the region who can provide first-hand information as well as translating all information into local languages.???It???s important that we???re able to communicate in different languages, because the best thing we can do is to bring the problems to the attention of the public and let them decide,??? he says, noting the futility of directly asking a government or organization to change their ways.",1

Tsao says that the zoo will keep the hatchlings in their hatching nest, where temperature and humidity are controlled, and move them to a different nest after they have grown to a more stable size.The radiated tortoises have become critically endangered due to loss of habitats, poaching and smuggling. The species. which is native to southern Madagascar, has a mild temperament and can grow up to a carapace length of 41cm and weigh up to 10kg.During their breeding season, zoo keepers will regularly inspect the tortoises and loosen the soil in their enclosure, helping the female tortoises excavate holes for their eggs and ensure that the zoo can find their eggs soon after they are laid and move them to a controlled environment for artificial incubation.

KMT Legislator Lin Wei-chou (?????????) said.The review scheduled for today and tomorrow would be a second-round review of the bill, as Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chiu Yi-ying (??¡Ó??¢X???), a convener of the Economics Committee who presided over the review last week, promised to restart deliberations this week after acknowledging procedural flaws in last week???s controversial approval of the bill.Legislative Speaker Su Jia-chyuan (?????????) said that since the review is to be restarted, he had no idea why the KMT had to boycott the general assembly meeting, adding that occupying the podium should be seen as a last resort.???Using the tactic frivolously will only incur public disapproval,??? Su said.In the cross-caucus negotiation shunned by the KMT caucus, People First Party caucus whip Lee Hong-chun (?????????) called on the DPP caucus to guarantee that the bill would not be passed ???as a package??? and that revisions would be allowed to ensure the KMT caucus??? cooperation.DPP caucus secretary-general Lee Chun-yi (?????????) said that the committee review is being held to allow for a clause-by-clause review of the bill.???In the notice for [today???s] meeting, the words ???extensive discussion??? has been included,??? DPP caucus chief executive Yeh Yi-chin (????????¢D) said.Per the KMT???s request, Chiu has also been replaced by DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng (?????????), the other Economics Committee convener, Yeh said.DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming (??¡Â??????) said that during the negotiations, it was ???very clear that the KMT???s tactics, for both the pension reform and the infrastructure development plan, are simply to cause chaos.??????What they are calling for, such as an accountability mechanism [for the plan], can all be discussed and added in the bill during the committee review,???

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,??? DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (?????????) said.???The founding philosophy of the WHA is health for all, but the reality is health for all except for Taiwanese,??? Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation. Is the KMT speaking for China or Taiwan???? Wang said.There should be no preconditions for WHA membership, and using membership as political leverage runs counter to the principles on which the WHO is founded, Lo said.Taiwan is an important contributor to global immunization and disaster relief, and the nation???s health insurance system ensures quality and affordable healthcare to all citizens, which has been closely studied by governments and international medical bodies, DPP Legislator and TMA president Chiu Tai-yuan (??¡Ó??¢X???) said.Taiwan is ranked first in Asia and sixth in the world in terms of palliative care, and this global leader in healthcare and medicine should not be excluded from the WHA for political reasons, Chiu said.China has also attempted to pressure the World Medical Association (WMA) to rename the TMA the ???Taiwan China Medical Association,??? TMA secretary-general Wang Bi-sheng (?????????) said.The Chinese association issued a written request during the WMA general assembly in Zambia last month for the name change, but the request was rejected because WMA members understood that the TMA is a non-political body and the issue should not be treated politically, Wang said.???China had made informal proposals to change the name of the TMA, but it was the first time it issued a written request. It is expected that China will make another formal request at the general assembly in October,??? Wang said.",2

I am willing to take any and all legal responsibility, and bet my political career on it,??? he said.Hsiao added there are a ???whole pack of wolves??? preying on students at cram schools and education authorities should take measures to protect young women.The Humanistic Education Foundation???s southern Taiwan office director Chang Ping (??????) said her office recently received two reports of alleged rapes at cram schools.Since 2011, about 40 to 50 teachers are fired each year over rape or sexual harassment allegations, and about 200 of those former teachers are believed to have found employment in cram schools, Chang said.The foundation has been lobbying education authorities to set up a system of background checks for potential cram school employees and to enhance sex education to let children know how to protect themselves, she said.The Supplementary Education Act should be amended to bolster government oversight of behavior and standards of cram-school employees, Chang said.Separately yesterday, Kaohsiung Supplementary Education Association president Chen Hsin-hsiung (?????????) said that the organization requires members to hire only instructors who can provide a clean Police Criminal Record Certificate.However, while the association has about 200 members, non-association members outnumber them by about five to one, he said.",1
297,Front Page,"Hamas on Monday unveiled a new policy document easing its stance on Israel after having called for years for the country???s destruction, as the Palestinian Islamist movement seeks to improve its international standing.The move came ahead of a first face-to-face meeting today between US President Donald Trump and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah party remains deeply divided from Hamas.The document was unveiled in the Qatari capital, Doha, by exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, who is due to step down soon after serving his maximum of two terms.Meshaal said he hoped the new US administration would ???act with more seriousness on the Palestinian cause and change its misconceptions about the Palestinian people.???The press conference was also broadcast live in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian enclave controlled by Hamas, and the document was posted on the movement???s Web site.???We in Hamas believe that renewal and reinvention is a necessity,??? Meshaal said at the event in a Doha hotel.While the new document does not amount to recognition of Israel as demanded by the international community, Hamas officials said, it formally softens its stance in a few key areas.Hamas leaders have long spoken of the more limited aim of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip without explicitly setting this out in their charter.However, after years of internal debate, the new document formally accepts the idea of a state in the territories occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967.The document also says its struggle is not against Jews because of their religion, but against Israel as an occupier.???We are not fighting against the Jews because they are Jewish,??? Meshaal said.???We are waging this struggle against the aggression of Zionists,??? he said.However, the original 1988 charter will not be dropped, just supplemented, in a move some analysts see as a way of maintaining the backing of hardliners.Asked if Hamas would negotiate directly with Israelis, Meshaal said: ???Our policy is we will not engage in direct negotiations with the Israelis, because nothing in the conditions and circumstances convinces us that any conclusions can be reached.???Direct talks is ???a process, it???s a game we will not fall for it,??? he said.The new document also continues to speak of liberating historic Palestine, including areas that are today part of Israel.Hamas is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US and the EU, and the new document is aimed in part at easing its international isolation.One Hamas leader, Ahmed Yusef, earlier said that the updated charter was ???more moderate, more measured and would help protect us against accusations of racism, anti-Semitism and breaches of international law.???It also does not refer to the Muslim Brotherhood, to which Hamas was closely linked when formed.However, Israel was not convinced, with David Keye, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying: ???Hamas is attempting to fool the world, but it will not succeed.??????They dig terror tunnels and have launched thousands upon thousands of missiles at Israeli civilians,???

The TRA sought compensation of NT$313 million. A district court ruled in favor of the driver and the truck company, asking them to pay only NT$210 million.The case is still being deliberated at the Taiwan High Court, the agency said.",1

It was the first local government in the nation to do so.Nan Hsing, in Changhua City, asked Changhua Christian Hospital director Yang Jui-cheng (?¢D???????) to talk to its students yesterday about the benefits of drinking water.Individuals should drink 100 to 150 milliliters (ml) of water at a time, not 500ml ??? as with some bottled drinks ??? at once, he told the students, adding that water should be drunk warm and in small mouthfuls.Consuming sports drinks for electrolytes means consuming too much sugar and additives, Yang  added.Nan Hsing principal Ko Po-ju (??¡Â??¡Â???) said he has discussed with his faculty how to get students to drink more water while at school.They decided the school would boil kettles of water and ask students to drink a certain amount of water before every class, and that drinking more water would be encouraged after physical education classes or sports club periods, he said.Faculty members would also be required to drink 1,500ml of water daily, he said.Changhua County Commissioner Wei Ming-ku (???????¢X¡P), who attended Yang???s talk, said he switched from sweetened drinks to plain water 10 years ago.???To quench one???s thirst, drinking boiled water is the cheapest and best way.

(????????????).Learning traditional characters and Bopomofo could cause trouble for South Koreans if they were to take a Mandarin test back home, where neither system is used, and could lower their chances of getting Mandarin-related jobs in China or South Korea, she said.The Test of Chinese as a Foreign Language (TOCFL) exams are not offered enough in Taiwan, making it less likely that students can pass the test within the timeframes they set for themselves, she said.The computer-based exams are offered three times a year.Ministry of Education Counselor Chiu Yu-chan (??¡Ó??????) said TOCFL exams are overseen by the Steering Committee for the Test of Hanyu Proficiency.If the TOCFL exams were to be administered as frequently as private language institutes offer the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exams, the ministry would have to work out the details with each offering institute individually, which is impractical, Chiu said.However, the ministry would consider granting the committee the right to qualify private language institutions as TOCFL exam venues, she said.American Austin Keough told lawmakers that tuition for Mandarin classes at Tamkang University has risen sharply, and was now double what it was four years ago.Labor restrictions mean that American students have to be studying in Taiwan for 18 months before they are eligible to apply for part-time jobs, meaning they have to save strenuously before they come to Taiwan to cover their expenses, Keough said.???I cannot guarantee that Taiwan has the lowest tuition for learning Mandarin, but I hope that it is the most satisfying in terms of learning quality,??? Chiu said.???I cannot guarantee that I am not satisfied. In fact, I am very satisfied with Taiwanese teachers??? ability to teach Mandarin,??? Keough replied, prompting laughter from others at the symposium.Hsiao told Keough to lobby the US government to have the US join Taiwan???s Working Holiday Visa program.Zanst Othman, an Iraqi Kurd, said when he studied Mandarin at the Chinese Culture University, an hour of daily class time was alloted for elective courses, including simplified Chinese and listening comprehension.???However, Hoklo [also known as Taiwanese], which I wanted to learn the most, was missing,??? he said.Noviyanti Oentoro, an Indonesian studying at Shih Hsin, said she chose Taiwan over China for learning Mandarin because of the Chinese accents, which sounded ???rude.???",1

CIER president Wu Chung-shu (?????????) told a news conference.Despite the slowdown, the PMI stayed comfortably above the neutral mark of 50 as local firms started to benefit from inventory build-up for next-generation electronic gadgets, Wu said.PMI data aim to capture the health of the manufacturing industry, with scores above 50 indicating expansion and those below suggesting contraction.Many Taiwanese technology firms are responsible for supplying chips, flat panels, camera lenses, batteries, casings and other critical components for smartphones, smart watches, laptops, desktop PCs and peripheral products.It is the second consecutive month the measure has been above the 60-point level as technological seasonality is increasingly inconspicuous, said CIER economist Chen Shin-hui (?????????), who conducts the survey.Traditionally, the first half is the slow sales season for technology products, but inventory build-up now takes place six months ahead of new product launches, usually slated for September, Supply Management Institute in Taiwan (?????¡Â???????????????????????????) executive director Steve Lai (?????????) said, as local firms gain a deeper exposure to the supply chains of global technology brands.Machinery equipment manufacturers are likely to benefit from inventory build-up earlier than chipmakers and other component suppliers, Lai said, adding that the second half would still be better than the first.Lai and other economists are also positive about a potential US investment by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (?????¡P????¡Â?).The move would allow Hon Hai and other local firms to take advantage of advanced research and development talent in the US, the world???s largest end-market for technology products, Lai said.Unlike the Chinese ???Red??? supply chain that is seeking to replace Taiwanese firms, the manufacturing-in-the-US trend poses a business opportunity for local machinery tool makers, Wu said.Academia Sinica economics researcher Kamhon Kan (?¢X??????¢F) voiced a similar view, saying investment in the US would help expand the markets of local exporters as they seek to stay competitive.The non-manufacturing industry also reported a business upturn last month, with the non-manufacturing purchasing managers??? index climbing to 56.3 from 55.1 in March, the CIER said in a separate report.",1

324,Business,"US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the administration of US President Donald Trump sets out to dramatically cut taxes.Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, almost a week after he helped unveil plans to cut taxes for many people and corporations to 15 percent, Mnuchin said tax reform and regulatory relief would help spur economic growth.Mnuchin???s comments also came days after government data showed tepid economic growth of 0.7 percent for the past three months.???The tax plan is our version of a jobs bill,??? Mnuchin said in an onstage interview with journalist Maria Bartoromo.Although the stock market has reacted positively to Trump???s election ??? with the S&P; 500 up 11 percent since November last year ??? critics of the tax plan have said it is ambitious and lacks details.In a light-hearted moment, Mnuchin quipped that many at the conference had him to thank for the surge in bank stocks that has helped lift their portfolios, bringing laughter from the audience, but with few fresh details about Trump???s plans and an uncertain time frame, some at the conference expressed concern that the generally optimistic atmosphere might begin to fade.???I???m concerned that if we don???t see tax or healthcare reform by the end of the year, markets will start to doubt the administration???s ability to deliver it,??? Guggenheim Partners global chief investment officer Scott Minerd said.Mnuchin said he has been working with congressional leaders to push tax reform and he hopes for bipartisan support. Mnuchin told CNBC on the sidelines of the conference that the tax proposal was purposely vague so that the administration could work with legislators to craft something that would pass the US Congress.The Trump administration has invited many business leaders into the White House, and is listening closely to their concerns and hopes on tax changes, he added.Goldman Sachs Group Inc president and joint chief operating officer David Solomon said the great sense of optimism early in Trump???s tenure might be fading.???This quarter, it feels like conviction for tax and regulatory reform is more muted,??? Solomon said.Solomon???s predecessor at Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, joined the Trump administration as director of the National Economic Council and one of his primary goals has been to work on tax reform.One concern associated with the Trump tax plan is how the government plans to pay for it. Mnuchin said that there are plenty of other ways to off set the revenue that would be lost through reduced tax receipts. He did not offer many specifics.Indeed many at the conference, including investment managers whose businesses could benefit dramatically from the cut in taxes, were cheering the new administration and its can-do attitude, which also includes plans to tackle healthcare reform.Prospects for growth look to be better around the world, several attendees said.Yet there were also some rumblings of concern that ambitious projects would not be completed and that tensions around the world with other governments would increase.Allianz SE chief economic adviser Mohamed El-Erian said that optimism is off the charts according to the stock market, but geopolitical issues are a real concern.",1

So we???re going to look at that.???Trump also said he is open to increasing the US gasoline tax to fund infrastructure development, in a further sign that policies unpopular with the Republican establishment are under consideration in the White House.He described higher gasoline taxes as acceptable to truckers ??? ???I have one friend who???s a big trucker,??? he said ??? as long as the proceeds are dedicated to improving US highways.During last year???s presidential campaign, Trump called for a ???21st century??? version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act that required the separation of consumer and investment banking.The Republican party platform also backed restoring the legal barrier, which was repealed in 1999 under a financial deregulation signed by then-US president Bill Clinton.A handful of lawmakers blame the repeal for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis, an argument that Wall Street flatly rejects.Trump could not unilaterally restore the law ??? US Congress would have to pass a new version.Trump officials, including US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, have offered support for bringing back some version of Glass-Steagall, though they have offered scant details on an updated approach.Both Mnuchin and Cohn are former bankers who worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.The KBW Bank Index of 24 major US lenders had climbed as much as 1.2 percent before Trump???s comment, before dropping about 1 percentage point.The index soon recovered most of that and was up 0.9 percent as of 1:07pm in New York on Monday.Firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, the nation???s two largest banks, were among the companies that swooned.The Glass-Steagall Act essentially split banking into two categories ??? deposit-taking companies backed by taxpayers that primarily made loans to businesses and consumers, and investment banks and insurers that trade and underwrite securities, and create or focus on other complex instruments.Severing those businesses would prevent Americans??? nest eggs from flowing into more volatile capital markets, US Congress reasoned at the time.Trump said the tax cuts he is seeking would, along with renegotiated trade agreements, serve as badly needed stimulus for the economy.The president called first-quarter economic growth, which the US Department of Commerce said declined to a 0.7 percent annual rate, ???really bad.???Although he has taken credit for monthly job growth figures and stock market gains since entering office on Jan. 20, Trump said he is not responsible for the GDP number.???That???s really a leftover from ??? in all fairness, I just got here,???

Sikka said.While Indian outsourcing companies have recruited in the US, Infosys is the first to come out with concrete hiring numbers and provide a time line in the wake of Trump???s visa review.Indian IT service firms, which typically flood the lottery system each year with thousands of applications, have been among the largest H1-B recipients annually.Indian politicians and IT industry heads have been lobbying US lawmakers and officials from the Trump administration to not make drastic changes to visa rules, as this could hurt India???s US$150 billion IT service sector.The 10,000 new US jobs would be a small part of Infosys??? overall workforce of more than 200,000.???We started small at first and have been growing since then,??? Sikka said. ???The reality is, bringing in local talent and mixing that with the best of global talent in the times we are living in and the times we???re entering is the right thing to do. It is independent of the regulations and the visas.???The four hubs being set up are not only to have technology and innovation focus areas, but also closely serve clients in sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, retail and energy, Infosys said.The first hub, which is to open in Indiana in August, is expected to create 2,000 jobs by 2021, the company said.Infosys did not disclose the financial impact of its plans. It declined to comment on whether the planned US jobs would account for a large percentage of overall hiring in the coming two years.However, based on Infosys??? hiring trends, the planned hirings in the US could account for a substantial portion of the company???s net workforce additions over the period.Infosys, which added nearly 18,000 jobs in 2015, slowed its hiring pace considerably, creating just 6,000 jobs last year amid market uncertainty caused by Brexit and heightened clamor for tougher US immigration laws that led some US clients to postpone new projects.???Hiring locally is a compulsion and it???s not just because of what???s happening in the US,??? Reliance Securities research analyst Harit Shah said. ???The model itself is not sustainable.???The company cautioned last month that it would struggle to reach its ambitious US$20 billion revenue target by 2020, as the Indian software service sector has been hit by cautious client spending due to a rising protectionist wave globally.",1
327,Business,"Airbnb Inc on Monday agreed to settle a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, putting to rest litigation that could have hampered the company???s efforts to expand and go public.In the settlement, Airbnb essentially agreed to San Francisco???s demand to be more transparent about its hosts and to help enforce existing registration laws.It followed the company???s dropping of a lawsuit in December last year over a New York law that fines people who illegally list their homes on short-term rental platforms.Taken together, the actions mean Airbnb has cleared up outstanding litigation in two of its biggest markets in the US.The latest settlement removes a regulatory cloud over the company as it readies itself for a public offering, even though Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco and has a valuation of about US$30 billion, still faces legal disputes in a handful of markets.Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky said earlier this year that the company could be ready to go public in a year.???As Airbnb gears up to go public over the next couple of years, creating a stable environment with less regulatory uncertainty is good for them,??? said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University???s Stern School of Business who studies the sharing economy. ???While it is well past the point where regulations pose an existential threat to the company, regulatory issues are still the biggest source of uncertainty about its future revenue streams.???Airbnb and another short-term rental company, HomeAway Inc, brought the lawsuit against San Francisco in June last year over a decision by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to fine the companies US$1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service.???Three years ago, we said the law being passed, which was written by Airbnb, won???t work because there was no skin in the game in terms of enforcement,??? David Campos, a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said at a news conference announcing the settlement.Under the settlement between the city and the companies, Airbnb and other services such as HomeAway have to collect data from people who rent their homes out for less than a month on their Web sites. San Francisco is to use that information to vet and register hosts.Companies such as Airbnb have to regularly provide the city with the data it needs to enforce local laws. The companies also have to cancel reservations and deactivate listings if the city notifies them of an invalid registration.???There are 2,100 registered hosts and about 8,000 listed.

329,Business,"CHINAPMI at seven-month lowThe nation???s factory sector lost momentum last month, with growth slowing to its weakest pace in seven months as domestic and export demand faltered and commodity prices fell, a private survey showed yesterday. The findings reinforced views that the nation???s economic growth remains solid, but is starting to moderate after a surprisingly strong start to the year. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers??? Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 last month, missing economists??? forecasts of 51.0 and a significant decline from March???s 51.2. The index remained above the 50.0 mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, but only just, and grew at its slowest pace since September last year. The survey suggested growth faded at a sharper pace than the official reading, but economists largely attributed the softening to a pullback in global commodity prices and signs of the property market moderating.AUSTRALIAInterest rates unchangedThe central bank kept its interest rates unchanged as faster inflation and signals of looming fiscal stimulus combine with an upswing in global growth. ???Above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies,??? Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement announcing the decision yesterday. ???The improvement in the global economy has contributed to higher commodity prices, which are providing a significant boost to Australia???s national income.???

The investments are both part of the start-up???s B round of funding and it is close to raising a third tranche, the people said.UNITED KINGDOMPMI unexpectedly hits 57.3Manufacturing unexpectedly grew at the fastest pace in three years last month as the domestic market strengthened and the British pound???s depreciation boosted exports.

That was far better than the 54 forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey and above the 50 level dividing expansion from contraction. The report reinforces the view that exporters are in what Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has called a ???sweet spot,??? since the currency???s decline has increased competitiveness, while the kingdom still enjoys free trade with the EU.

The public also needs to be educated that victims of sexual assault are not at fault, but the perpetrators are.Simply feeling sad does not bring about change; the public should turn this death into collective strength, a catalyst to start making a difference.",1

Had it not been for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) agreeing not to nominate candidates in some districts, there would have been no room for small parties in the legislative elections and it would have been difficult for them to gain more than three legislator-at-large seats, which would have sharply reduced their influence, as three legislators are required to form a caucus.Despite a substantial presence on the political map, pro-independence advocates want to guide the DPP, and while the party is careful to make a show of respecting their opinions, it is in practice ignoring them.After all, how could the members of a weak political movement possibly direct a strong party?In the end, the independence movement will stagnate and we can only hope that someone will be able to pull it back to reality.Chen Mao-hsiung is a retired National Sun Yat-sen University professor and chairman of the Society for the Promotion of Taiwanese Security.Translated by Eddy Chang",1
332,Editorials,"With the commotion surrounding pension reform, it is becoming necessary to speak from the heart in support of the workers who are remaining silent.A lot of people have noted that in the current proposal, employees in the public sector who have worked just as many years as a civil servant would not receive more than a maximum monthly pension of NT$30,000, while some would not even get NT$20,000.However, the minimum a civil servant would receive is NT$32,160. The maximum pension from the labor insurance program would fall far short of the minimum payment for civil servants.It would be as if elderly people were living in two different countries.All the many reasons forwarded in the media in support of the high pensions for public servants ??? military personnel, civil servants and public-school teachers ??? are wrong. The arguments that they are justified because their exams were difficult, because the military protects the nation and because the work of police officers and firefighters is dangerous are all wrong.First: Exams and high standards explain how difficult it is to become a civil servant or a teacher, but once they retire, these reasons for a high salary vanish, because they are clearly irrelevant to retirement pay.Is there any industry where difficult exams and high employee standards are guarantees for high productivity and thus high pay?There is no economic theory to support this argument, nor is there such an industry in real life.If it does not even apply to salaries, then it should also be completely irrelevant to pensions. High pay for civil servants and public-school teachers is acceptable if they are highly productive, but once they retire, their productivity drops to zero.How, then, can the differences in retirement pay be justified?Second: A pension should allow a retiree the ability to maintain a minimum standard of living.Other expenses, like travel, should be handled through savings and investments.This is a fundamental principle, so why can public servants with their high standards not understand that?Third: Danger, hard work and time away from family are reasons that could apply to any number of professions, including police officers, sailors and flight attendants.These factors, risks and difficulties are taken into consideration during service and are reflected in salaries.If people receive high pensions, they are being rewarded twice for the same thing.Furthermore, after retirement, the risks disappear, and neither security personnel, police officers nor firefighters are productive any more.Why should security personnel receive lower pensions than police officers?Fourth: Some people say that military personnel, civil servants and public-school teachers were the most important force behind the nation???s economic development and that without these groups we would not have the economic prosperity and national defense that Taiwan enjoys today.This is wrong.With the exception of publicly owned businesses, these groups are part of the consumer services industry ??? the military and police ??? or the indirect producer services industry ??? teachers, for example, who help increase production, but do so indirectly, without participating directly in production.Workers were the only ones who participated directly in production and economic activities, and they made the biggest contribution to the economy.",1

When a nation faces a strong and powerful threat at its border, it is an eternal truth that it must first deal with its own internal issues before it can tackle an external enemy, but in the past year, since President Tsai Ing-wen???s (?????¡Ó???) administration came to power, a series of reforms have been promoted which have set social classes and ethnic groups against each other, with the prospect of the winner taking all.Reforms bring progress, so naturally they are welcomed.However, historical progress has its own logic of development, which can be understood through dialectical historical thought, often attributed to German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and also known as ???thesis, antithesis, synthesis.???The theory states that without a dialectic ??? or dialogue ??? achieving progress becomes fruitless: like climbing a tree to catch fish.CONFLICTThe principle of the dialectic is very simple: When a conflict occurs between a proposition (thesis) and a negation of that thesis (antithesis), the two sides should not try to eliminate each other, because if they do, the dialectic will cease to exist.Instead both parties should reconcile views or ideas and form a new position (synthesis).The new position will attract new opponents, and the thesis-antithesis-synthesis dialectic continues, until finally reaching the perfect end of history.Unfortunately, many recent political and social issues have repeatedly torn apart Taiwanese society, such as the government???s proposal to legalize same-sex marriage, the ???one fixed day off and one flexible rest day??? labor reform, pension reform and judicial reform, to name just a few.BUBBLESThe Tsai administration has failed to deal with them properly, which has lead to hostility between dissenting groups.Tension is mounting which has resulted in a lack of trust which could lead to societal collapse.In particular, due to Internet ???filter bubbles,??? in recent years people have inevitably connected with those who share similar viewpoints and listen to the same opinions, and when they hear a different voice, they hate it as the poisonous venom of the ???enemy.???Living in this Internet culture, filter bubbles have taken our ability to have rational dialogue with those with whom we disagree. We should try to understand each other???s arguments with empathy, for only after we place ourselves in the shoes of others ??? and still refute their argument ??? can we be sure that we are not blinded by prejudice, ignorance or ideology.COHESIVENESSIt is not too late to fix the situation. With the power of a majority, the main mistake the Democratic Progressive Party government has made is to assume that it is on the side of absolute justice, criticizing its opponents, wanting to force its way in everything and consequently making everyone feel battered and bruised.Taking on board the objections to form a synthesis that transcends conflicting arguments and opinions has the potential to transform the government???s reform process into a driving force for change which would foster internal cohesiveness and ensure the public???s identification with society goes from strength to strength.It is also the best guarantee for the security of Taiwan.Allen Houng is a professor at National Yang Ming University???s Institute of Philosophy of Mind and Cognition.",1

Airlines also warn that fees will need to be low to encourage them to switch.???It???s a burden that the government has the capacity to bear - the burden being not simply the costs, but the risks,??? independent economist Saul Eslake said. ???Nobody really knows what the demand for services at this facility is likely to be.???Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the project would inject more than A$1.9 billion into the economy during the construction phase alone.It is expected to open in late 2026 and boost inbound air passenger numbers to Sydney by about a quarter, or 10 million people per year in the early years.Sydney Airport, which had first right of refusal to build the airport, said earlier yesterday that it would not proceed with the project which it had previously called ???deeply uneconomic.??????The risks associated with the development and operation of the airport are considerable, and that will continue for many decades without commensurate returns for our investors,??? Sydney Airport chief executive Kerrie Mather said at the Macquarie Australia Conference, an economic forum.Sydney Airport will lose its monopoly as a result, but it could benefit from lower-margin domestic traffic migrating to the second airport, allowing it to accept more lucrative international traffic, analysts say.The semi-rural site at Badgery???s Creek on Sydney???s western outskirts was first mooted in 1946 as the limits of the first airport ??? hemmed in by suburbs and the sea in the city???s east ??? became clear.The new airport is initially envisaged as a low-cost hub for mostly domestic flights by airlines like Qantas Airways??? budget arm Jetstar.Sydney Airport has the highest landing fees in Australia.???You need to have it like Stansted, a low-cost operation, an airport that???s designed for those purposes,???

The girl had been told her knee-length dress was ???seductive and a temptation from a certain angle far, far away,??? he said in the post on Thursday last week, demanding an apology from the organizers.His remarks sparked a flurry of furious responses on social media, with commenters expressing indignation at the incident and questioning how organizers could have deemed the clothing inappropriate.???I am shocked and disturbed that her dress is a problem,??? said Sieh Kok Chi, former secretary-general of the Olympic Council of Malaysia. ???She is just 12 years old. No one has the right to impose self-made rules. The chess officials should resign.???Federation executive secretary Nik Hishamuddin Nik Mustapa said that the dress code had been implemented because the competition was played in a public school, which has a stricter dress code.",1
345,World News,"Traditional May 1 union marches turned violent in France on Monday and presidential election frontrunner Emmanuel Macron attacked far-right rival Marine Le Pen, highlighting the divisions six days before the runoff.Six police officers were hurt in clashes in Paris between masked youths throwing Molotov cocktails and riot police who responded with tear gas, as tens of thousands of union protesters took to the streets for May Day demonstrations.One riot police officer was engulfed in flames, an Agence France-Presse photographer saw.French Minister of the Interior Matthias Fekl condemned the violence and said one officer was seriously burned on the hand, while another had serious burns to the face, without saying which was the officer in the photograph.Reacting to the scenes, far-right presidential candidate Le Pen tweeted: ???This is the sort of mess ... that I no longer want to see on our streets.???In a feisty speech, Macron told thousands of his supporters he would defend ???free democracy??? if voters choose him on Sunday after Le Pen had urged voters to reject ???the world of finance, of arrogance, of money as king??? she said her opponent embodied.The traditional union-led marches underlined the conspicuous absence of the united front shown in 2002, when Le Pen???s father, Jean-Marie, shocked the nation by reaching the run-off.On this day 15 years ago, about 1.3 million people, including 400,000 in Paris, took to the streets of France in union-led demonstrations to protest against the founder of the National Front (FN).That show of force, coupled with a political closing of ranks, helped the center-right???s Jacques Chirac inflict a crushing defeat on Le Pen senior.This time, with left-wing candidates eliminated in the first round, the left is deeply divided over the choice between Le Pen???s 48-year-old daughter and Macron, a 39-year-old former investment banker.In Paris???s Place de la Republique, 28-year-old teacher Camille Delaye held a placard that read: ???Abstention is a political act??? ??? meaning he is so disgusted by both candidates, he will not vote on Sunday.However, Nastassja Naguszewski, 28, who works in local government, said: ???You have to put [Marine] Le Pen as low as possible. One of them is a candidate who will uphold republican values and one is not.???Two unions, the CFDT and Unsa, have called for their members to back Macron.However, while three other more left-wing unions including the biggest, the CGT, have called for demonstrations against Marine Le Pen???s vision of French identity, they have stopped short of backing Macron whose economically liberal outlook worries many members.Some militants have formed a movement they have called ???Social Front??? to block both candidates.CGT leader Philippe Martinez said he ???deeply disagreed??? with that approach, arguing that Le Pen and Macron ???are not the same thing.??????The National Front is a racist, xenophobic party that is anti-women and anti-workers because it is also an economically liberal party,??? he said.Marine Le Pen hit back that the unions ???are not defending workers??? interests, they are looking after their own interests.???Macron is currently favorite to become France???s youngest ever president, leading Le Pen by 19 points in the polls, but she has shown she is an effective campaigner.Speaking at a convention center in northern Paris, Macron said his rival ???had fed off worry and hate for years.???",1
346,World News,"Aides of French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen yesterday brushed off criticism of her use of phrases lifted straight from a speech by conservative rival Francois Fillon in her May Day address to supporters.Florian Philippot, deputy leader of Le Pen???s anti-EU National Front  party, said the party ???completely owned up??? to the fact that the speech resembled one by Fillon a month ago ??? similarities that were mocked by her opponents on social media overnight.Philippot told Radio Classique that Le Pen???s speech was a ???nod-and-a-wink??? to Fillon???s earlier discourse in order to ???launch a real debate??? concerning French identity.French newspapers and media all highlighted the similarities between Le Pen???s speech at her rally on Monday and one by Fillon given on April 15 before he was knocked out of the presidential contest.In a speech to her supporters at a rally north of Paris on Monday, Le Pen ??? who faces centrist frontrunner Emmanuel Macron in a run-off vote on Sunday ??? spoke of France???s long and proud history and the nation???s roots in Western Europe.Le Pen mentioned France???s ???three maritime borders??? with the English Channel, North Sea and the Atlantic. That same phrase of France???s ???three maritime borders??? with the English Channel, North Sea and the Atlantic was also used by Fillon on April 15.Le Pen also described France???s borders and ties with ???Italy, our sister??? ??? again a phrase used in Fillon???s April 15 speech.Le Pen also evoked a quote from early 20th-century French prime minister Georges Clemenceau, who said: ???Once a soldier of God, and now a soldier of Liberty, France will always be the soldier of the ideal.???That Clemenceau quotation was also used, word-for-word, by Fillon at his rally.Le Pen???s campaign manager, David Rachline, also played down plagiarism accusations, painting her speech as a form of tribute to Fillon.The reference ???was appreciated, including by all of Mr Fillon???s supporters,???

347,World News,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday was scheduled to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on her first visit to Russia since 2015, in a signal of renewed dialogue as deep strains remain over Ukraine.The Russian and German leaders have scaled back links as Moscow???s ties with the EU plunged to a post-Cold War low over the crisis in Ukraine.Berlin has said the meeting will ???above all??? focus on the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, in July and no major breakthroughs are expected on bridging the deep rifts between the two sides.Merkel has strongly backed EU sanctions on Russia for seizing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and supporting the pro-Kremlin separatist insurgency in the east of the country.Moscow has responded with an embargo on agricultural products from the West, and a European-brokered peace plan to end the conflict has hit a dead end.In her first official visit to Russia last week, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini insisted that cooperation between the two sides was ???not frozen,??? but said that progress was hampered by profound disagreements on subjects including Ukraine and Syria.Merkel???s visit to Russia comes after Putin called for the countries??? relations ???to fully normalize,??? while meeting German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel in March.Merkel last visited Russia in May 2015, when she met Putin in Moscow but, like most Western leaders, snubbed a Red Square parade for the 70th anniversary of World War II victory.The German leader has been the main mediator with Putin over the crisis in Ukraine. She is a key proponent of keeping sanctions on Moscow in place until a stalled peace plan to end the conflict in Europe???s backyard is fulfilled.Merkel and Putin have taken part in a number of four-way meetings, most recently in October, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and French President Francois Hollande aimed at implementing the plan the four countries hammered out in February 2015.Last month, Merkel and Putin took part in a four-way phone conversation with Poroshenko and Hollande, agreeing to step up implementation of the peace deal.???There are two topics that weigh down relations ... the annexation of Crimea contrary to international law and then the destabilization of eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists,??? Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters ahead of the visit.Kiev and the West accuse Moscow of giving military support to the rebels in eastern Ukraine, a charge it denies.Seibert called this ???a difficult context that one cannot ignore,??? but added that ???our intention is to try to integrate Russia into constructive agreements.???Both sides have also said the talks will cover the conflict in Syria, where Putin???s military backing for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has set him at odds with the West.The Kremlin added that the visit would be an opportunity ???to discuss the current state and prospects of bilateral relations???.The G20 is now the only format for Russia to meet the other major international powers after its exclusion from the G8, now the G7.At the G20 summit, Putin is expected to meet US President Donald Trump.

348,World News,"Perched spectacularly 2,000m up on a snowcapped peak in Ukraine???s Carpathian Mountains, the Bilyi Slon observatory has stood empty and battered by the elements for about seven decades.Abandoned only a year after it was built in what was then Poland due to the outbreak of World War II, it became a carcass of thick sandstone walls and missing windows that looked more like a ruined castle than a scientific outpost.Now, with efforts under way to raise about US$1 million in funding, scientists aim to restore the wreck and transform it into a learning center for young researchers studying wildlife, plants and weather patterns.???There was no roof; all the floors were warped,??? local mountain rescuer Vasyl Fitsak, part of a small crew stationed there, said, as icy winds swirled outside. ???There were piles of bricks, stones and trash that hikers left here for years. Some piles reached 2m in height.???Work on rebuilding the observatory ??? nicknamed Bilyi Slon (White Elephant) by locals because of how it looks when covered in snow ??? started in 2012. Scientists hope that significant progress on the restoration will be made by next year, when the observatory marks its 80th anniversary.So far, the copper roof has been restored and debris cleared from much of the building. However, tough conditions mean that progress has been slow and there remains a lot to be done.Snowstorms and freezing temperatures mean that work can only go ahead six months of the year and no more than 10 construction workers can stay at any one time because of the cramped conditions.The observatory, which sits on the Pip Ivan peak, the second highest in the Chornogora mountain range, is a six-hour hike from the nearest town. In summer the only road for transporting up building materials becomes an impassable bog.The observatory???s location has not only proved inhospitable due to the dreadful weather. It has also been buffeted by the hurricane of history that has blown through this blood-soaked region in eastern Europe.Completed in 1938 on what was then the Polish-Czechoslovak border, the five-story observatory was equipped with a modern telescope and served as a base for Polish military meteorologists.However, after just one year, the scientists hurriedly packed up their equipment and fled as Soviet troops seized the area under a pact with Nazi Germany to divide Poland.The observatory then fell under Nazi control after Hitler???s invasion of the USSR and was used as a barracks until it was recaptured by Moscow???s forces in 1944.It remains unclear why the Soviet troops did not restore the facility, which ended up serving as a shelter for the few hardy hikers who made it up to the summit.Given its tumultuous history, the observatory never had the chance to fulfil its initial purpose as an astronomical observatory. Those behind the project ??? which has received its first tranche of funding from Poland???s culture ministry ??? said that conditions mean it is unlikely to be used for serious stargazing in the future.Curator Igor Tsependa said that the spot only enjoys about 60 cloudless days a year, while world-class observatories usually get as many as 330 clear days annually.Instead Tsependa, a university rector in the Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, hopes it will become a hub for studying local flora and fauna, as well as conducting weather studies.",1
349,World News,"Thai immigration authorities said the heir to the Red Bull energy drink fortune who is wanted on deadly hit-and-run charges flew to Singapore two days before he was due to appear before prosecutors.Airport authorities in Singapore yesterday confirmed his private plane is still there.When he left Bangkok, Vorayuth ???Boss??? Yoovidhya, 32, was not a fugitive, but on Friday, authorities issued an arrest warrant and notified Interpol that he is wanted on charges of causing death by reckless driving and hit and run.Thai police said they do not know if he has left Singapore, and Thailand???s foreign minister said he has not revoked Vorayuth???s passport, which means he could still travel elsewhere internationally.The arrest warrant came almost five years after Vorayuth allegedly left a motorcycle police officer dead after crashing into him with his Ferrari. His family, half-owners of the Red Bull empire, has an estimated wealth of more than US$20 billion.Thai Immigration Bureau Lieutenant General Nathatorn Prousoontor said that Vorayuth left Thailand at 3pm on a private jet on Tuesday last week.He left just weeks after an Associated Press investigation found he had been enjoying his family???s jet-set life ever since the 2012 accident and days before he was due in court.When approached a few weeks ago outside a family-owned home in London, Vorayuth refused to comment. Earlier this year AP watched him and his family enjoying a US$1,000-a-night vacation in Laos, and saw social media postings of him snowboarding in Japan, attending Grand Prix races with Red Bull and visiting beach resorts in Southeast Asia.All that time he has been repeatedly telling prosecutors, through his attorney, that he was sick or out of the country on business when called in to face charges.Nathatorn said Vorayuth was allowed to fly out last week because the trip came before the arrest warrant was issued.???The prosecutors are handling the case and there was no request to ban his traveling to us,??? he said. ???We only have been informed that the arrest warrant was issued on Friday, April 28, which is after he had left the country.???Although Singapore has no extradition agreement with Thailand, Interpol officials said police informally can arrange through other means to apprehend him there.Singapore police did not respond with comment immediately.Friends and family postings on social media show Vorayuth has been in Singapore every year since the accident, often at Formula 1 races, but also celebrating family birthdays and holidays.",1
350,World News,"The risk of extremist attacks in Switzerland remains elevated, the Swiss spy agency said yesterday, and more attacks by the Islamic State (IS) militant group and its sympathizers were expected across Europe.???In Switzerland, the terrorist threat remains at a heightened level,??? the Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) said in its annual assessment of risks faced by the nation.???The most likely terrorist threat in Europe and thus also in Switzerland will continue to come from jihad-motivated terrorism,??? it said. ???Further attacks must be expected.???The assessment was released as Europe still comes to terms with attacks in London and Paris linked to Islamist extremism.The agency said the greatest danger was that individuals or small groups inspired by Islamic State would carry out attacks in Switzerland or use it as a base to plot other attacks.FIS said it had identified more than 500 Internet users with Swiss connections who were using social media to spread extremist ideas.Concerns about extremism and potential attacks led to Swiss voters last year backing a law extending the national spy service???s authority to monitor Internet traffic, deploy drones and hack foreign computer systems.Switzerland has so far not been targeted directly in an Islamist attack, but it has had several links to attacks elsewhere in Europe last year.Two men who took hostages and killed a priest in northern France in July last year had traveled via airports in Geneva and Zurich.Another man who killed at least 12 people when he drove a truck into a crowded Berlin Christmas market had also visited Switzerland and might also have obtained a gun there.???It is not yet clear whether these links to Switzerland played any role in the attack,??? the FIS report said.With no indication the fight against Islamic State was coming to a close, there ???remains the considerable risk that the aggressive battle for the survival of the caliphate, fought using every means at their disposal, will increasingly be carried to Europe,??? the FIS report said.",1
351,World News,"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called for a new constitution on Monday as he fights to quell a crisis that has led to more than one month of protests against him and deadly street violence.The opposition immediately rejected the idea because the body drafting the new charter would not be the result of a popular election, but rather be composed of workers and farmers.Maduro???s announcement, to thousands of supporters in Caracas marking May Day, came as security forces sprayed tear gas and water cannons at anti-government demonstrators elsewhere in the capital.It was likely to sharpen international concerns over Venezuela???s adherence to democracy and fears it was slipping over a precipice to civil conflict.The opposition slammed the tactic as a ???coup d???etat??? and urged protesters to ???block the streets??? from yesterday.It said it was organizing a ???mega protest??? for today.???People, into the streets! You must disobey such lunacy!??? opposition leader Henrique Capriles said on Twitter.The leader of the nation???s opposition-held Congress, Julio Borges, said: ???What Maduro is proposing in his desperation is that Venezuela never again manages to have direct, free and democratic voting.???Maduro said he was invoking his power to create a 500-member constituent assembly representing a ???working-class base??? and local councils to rewrite the constitution ??? cutting out the Congress.The decree was needed to ???block the fascist coup??? he said threatened the country, repeating terms portraying his socialist government as the victim of a US-led capitalist conspiracy.The new constitution-writing entity would be ???a citizen???s constituent body, not from political parties ??? a people???s constituent body,??? he said.Maduro???s move mirrored that of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, who in 1999 had a 131-member constituent assembly of various representatives draw up Venezuela???s constitution. The text was overwhelmingly passed by a referendum.However, the charismatic Chavez enjoyed enthusiastic public support. Maduro, in contrast, is disapproved of by seven in 10 Venezuelans, according to pollsters Venebarometro.Anti-Maduro antipathy was evident on the streets on Monday. Riot police officers clashed with hundreds of protesters, some throwing stones, who tried to break through security barriers to the National Electoral Council building.Opposition leaders have vowed no letup in their protests demanding early elections to get rid of Maduro, whose term ends late next year.They blame him for an economic crisis that has caused shortages of food and medicine.Clashes between protesters and riot police left 28 people dead last month, according to prosecutors.A lawmaker was injured in the head in Caracas, photographs published online by his supporters showed. Similar protests took place in other towns across the country.Analysts said street rallies are one of the few means the opposition has left of pressuring Maduro.The president???s demand for a new constitution was a way of running out the clock on demands for elections, they said.The violence and political spiral in Venezuela is increasingly unsettling other countries and regional blocs.Pope Francis has offered to have the Vatican mediate, but was rebuffed by the opposition, which walked away from a previous attempt at dialogue in December last year when the government did not free political prisoners or set early elections as demanded.",1
352,World News,"Tens of thousands of people across the US peacefully chanted, picketed and protested on Monday against US President Donald Trump???s immigration and labor policies on May Day, despite a small pocket of violent unrest in the northwest.Peaceful protesters flocked to the streets in Chicago.At the White House gates, they shouted: ???Donald Trump has got to go.???However, police shut down a protest in Portland, Oregon, that they said had become a riot, after marchers began throwing smoke bombs and other items at officers.Police said they made more than two dozen arrests as a group of anarchists wearing black bandanas and ski masks grew unruly, reportedly breaking windows of businesses, setting fires on downtown streets and damaging a police vehicle.Five people in Seattle were arrested, one for hurling a rock as pro and anti-Trump demonstrators faced off.In the Washington State capital of Olympia, police ordered protesters to disperse, calling them ???members of a mob??? as some threw bottles, used pepper spray and fired marbles from slingshots at officers.Objects struck nine officers and nine people were arrested, Olympia Police Chief Ronnie Roberts said.In Oakland, California, at least four protesters were arrested after creating a human chain to block a county building where demonstrators demanded that county law enforcement refuse to collaborate with federal immigration agents.Despite the west coast clashes, most nationwide protests were peaceful, as immigrants, union members and their allies staged a series of strikes, boycotts and marches to highlight the contributions of immigrants in the US.Trump, in his first 100 days, has intensified immigration enforcement, including executive orders for a wall along the US-Mexico border and a ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries.Teachers working without contracts opened the day by picketing outside schools in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Advocates in Phoenix petitioned state legislators to support immigrant families.Thousands of union members and advocates marched in the shadow of some of the biggest resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, including a hotel that bears the president???s name.In a Los Angeles park, several thousand people waved US flags and signs reading ???love not hate.???The White House did not respond to requests for a response to the May Day demonstrations.In Providence, Rhode Island, about the same number of people gathered at Burnside Park before a two-hour protest that touched on deportation, profiling and wage theft.In Oakland at a later march, more than 1,000 people marched peacefully representing labor groups along with Mexican, Vietnamese, Chinese, Filipino and other immigrants.While union members traditionally march on May 1 for workers??? rights around the world, the day has become a rallying point for immigrants in the US since massive demonstrations were held on the date in 2006 against a proposed immigration enforcement bill.In recent years, immigrant rights protests shrank as groups diverged and shifted their focus on voter registration and lobbying. Larger crowds returned this year, prompted by Trump???s ascension to the presidency.Several protesters, such as Mario Quintero, 39, outed themselves as being in the country illegally to help make their point.???I???m an undocumented immigrant, so I suffer in my own experience with my family,??? said Quintero at a Lansing, Michigan, rally. ???That???s why I am here, to support not only myself but my entire community.???",1
353,World News,"US President Donald Trump???s administration on Monday took aim at two signature programs of former US first lady Michelle Obama, rolling back her efforts to promote healthy school lunches and potentially rebranding her program to educate adolescent girls abroad.US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that school meals would no longer have to meet some requirements connected with Obama???s initiative to combat childhood obesity by overhauling the nation???s school menus.The nutrition regulations were part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and were advocated by Obama???s ???Let???s Move??? campaign. For the past five years, US schools have been required to reduce the amount of calories, fat and sodium in their cafeterias and increase offerings of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nonfat milk to the about 32 million students who receive federally subsidized meals.Beginning next school year, schools can request an exemption from the whole grain requirements and delay the sodium mandate.They would also be able to serve 1 percent flavored milk instead of nonfat.Perdue said the Obama-era rules had resulted in increased costs for school districts and declining participation in the federal school lunch program.He said relaxing the rules was part of the administration???s effort to ???make school meals great again.??????If kids aren???t eating the food, and it???s ending up in the trash, they aren???t getting any nutrition ??? thus undermining the intent of the program,??? said Perdue, who announced the changes with a signed proclamation on Monday after having lunch with students at Catoctin Elementary School in Leesburg, Virginia.Perdue, a former governor of Georgia, was confirmed in his role last week.Since schools began complying with the nutrition standards in 2012, many have complained that they are too stringent and costly.The new rules were projected to cost US$3.2 billion over five years, but Perdue said they had cost states an additional US$1.22 billion in the 2015 fiscal year alone.The US Congress has allowed states to apply for waivers if they cannot meet certain standards.Trump???s administration also indicated on Monday that it was eyeing another program that Obama promoted.It was not clear how serious the administration was about targeting the program, Let Girls Learn, which was spearheaded by former US president Barack Obama and Michelle Obama in 2015 to increase educational opportunities for adolescent girls who face physical danger and other obstacles to going to school.In a letter circulated internally this week, a Peace Corps official said the initiative would no longer use the Let Girls Learn brand or operate as a discrete program, according to people familiar with the document, which was first reported by CNN.A senior Trump administration official said there was no plan to end or even rebrand the program, calling the letter a result of an unauthorized and erroneous decision by a career government employee.When US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson???s staff learned of the memo on Monday, they insisted that it be reviewed, said the official, who discussed private deliberations on the condition of anonymity.Tillerson???s spokesman RC Hammond declined to answer questions, providing only a terse statement that said: ???No changes have been made to the Let Girls Learn program.???",1

357,Features,"For theater and film buffs, British director Katie Mitchell???s production of Miss Julie for Berlin???s Schaubuhne theater at the National Theater last weekend was a treat.Mitchell???s retelling of Swedish author and playwright August Strindberg???s 1888 classic one-act play about class, gender and rebellion focuses on a behind-the-scenes view of Miss Julie, servant Jean and Kristen, the cook and Jean???s fiancee.Not only does she tell the story through Kristen???s eyes and ears, the audience sees the action from behind doors and through windows as well, as live theater is combined with video footage, both live and prerecorded, helped by Leo Warner???s film direction.The set is a mix of walls, windows and doors ??? with the walls moved back and forth to create small rooms, corridors, outdoor walkways ??? as well as two sound booths, props and shelving and a table where the sound foley crew of Maria Ueberschaer and Lisa Guth work their magic so that the audience can hear what Kristen and the other actors are doing.In addition to Jule Bowe as Kristin, Tilman Strauss as Jean and Luise Wolfram as Miss Julie, the audience could watch Cathlen Gawlich as Kristen???s double, camera operators Andreas Hartmann and Krzysztof Honowski and cellist Gabriella Strumpel.Everybody helps out. When not required for a scene, the actors help the film crew shift the walls, cameras and lighting equipment. It is a modern-day take on Strindberg???s stage directions that everything in a performance is done as naturally as possible.Mitchell does not tackle the entire play; she takes it as a given that the audience knows the basic story outline so she can focus on the small, everyday things, with the video providing an intimacy that usual stage productions cannot give.In the videos, the audience sees Kristen washing and slicing a kidney for Jean???s meal and later serving it to him with extra helpings of gravy, or using a glass pressed to the floorboards to listen to a fight between Miss Julie and Jean in the room below ??? actions that would have otherwise been hidden by the set walls or too far away for most audience memebers to see.The dialogue was minimal, with surtitles projected as part of the video, and the acting restrained.The overall effect of Mitchel???s vision was beautiful, and for those who are interested in the technical side of stage and movie productions, seeing it was a delight akin to being a child let loose in a sweet shop. However, like sweet shops, the visual stimulation in the end was overwhelming: There was just so much to look at that in the end you feared that you might have missed the best bits.The visual delights of Miss Julie, brought to the National Theater as part of the Taiwan International Festival of Arts, were equaled the preceding weekend by another program in the festival???s line-up, the Rocia Molina Company???s Bosque Ardora.Conceived by, directed by and starring Molina, the production promised something more than the usual flamenco show and it delivered.The show opens with a beautiful short film of nature ??? beautifully colored dawn sky, verdant trees, a lake or river, insects and animals into which the baying sounds of hunting dogs and a galloping horse???s hoofs can gradually be heard.Then glimpses of a horse and female rider; the hunted or the hunter? There is no way to tell before the rider, Molina, is unceremoniously dumped into the water by her horse, which gallops off.",1
358,Features,"Bu San Bu Si (????????????) or ???not three, not four??? ??? a Mandarin expression used to describe society???s misfits and lowlifes ??? is the second novel by Canadian freelance writer and heavy metal rocker Joe Henley. Having spent the last 12 years in Taipei playing with metal and punk bands and chronicling the scene for publications such as this newspaper, Henley takes his readers where we otherwise would not venture ??? to live music venues that are ???perpetually covered in mildew mold??? and recording studios with ???years of stale sweat ... soaked into the walls.??? Yet despite being about Taiwan???s underground punk music scene, the novel speaks to anyone who has experienced the pressure of conforming to a dominant culture that he or she finds stifling.While Henley???s first novel, Sons of the Republic, featured a well-to-do Taiwanese-American protagonist who squanders his money from his penthouse in Taipei???s posh Xinyi District, the characters in Bu San Bu Si are born into a world where they are expected to slug it out at desk jobs to support blue-collar parents who operate night market stands or work the night shift at hospitals. Henley deftly delves into their psyche and motivations, providing us with a glimpse into a world that???s rarely written about in English.TOUGH LUCKHenley???s protagonist, 20-year-old guitarist Xiao Hei, wears a beat-up leather jacket, even during the sweltering heat of Taipei???s summer, and eschews his responsibility as a ???golden son??? who is supposed to provide for his mother. He drifts away from childhood friends and aspiring musicians who have all ???faded away into civilian life.??? Having never traveled outside of Taiwan, Xiao Hei has lofty dreams of performing in countries whose names he reads on the labels of liquor bottles. But he drinks, gets into fist fights and constantly shows up late for band practice.Publication NotesBu San Bu Si: A Taiwan Punk Tale By Joe Henley346 pagesCamphor PressPaperback: TaipeiXiao Hei???s actions may seem reprehensible and inexcusable. But, as readers learn, advice like ???just be yourself??? or ???follow your dreams??? is nonsensical. As Henley fleshes out in brilliant and grotesque prose, employing transliterations ??? and, of course, plenty of swear words ??? in Mandarin and Hoklo (more commonly known as Taiwanese), life isn???t easy for people like Xiao Hei, who was raised by a single, alcoholic mother who herself came from a troubled family. For Xiao Hei, shunning traditional Confucian values, pursuing his dream and simply being himself come with consequences that eventually get him mixed up with Taipei???s criminal underworld.However, it???s not just gangsters who are corrupt. Like Sons of the Republic, the line separating criminals and law enforcement is blurred. As former gangster and bar owner Jackie Tsai tells Xiao Hei: ???It???s a wicked little game, the law.??? This is a lesson that is repeatedly knocked into Xiao Hei???s skull ??? literally and figuratively ??? starting from when he and his bandmates are publicly humiliated by politicians seeking to make an example of them. The men in ???suits and ties??? accuse the band of desecrating ???Chinese values??? and ???aping the decadence of the invasive Western culture.??? This is ironic because Westerners barely feature in the novel and it???s obvious that ???Chinese values??? are nothing but a hollow rallying call for politicians to further their own agendas, or parents to control their children.",1
359,Bilingual Pages,"When touring Green Island, aside from the usual must-see scenic spots, the island???s beautiful sunset is the exclusive scenic choice of the seasoned traveller. There are two main places to enjoy the sunset on Green Island. The first is at Green Island Lighthouse situated on the west coast of the island. Visitors can watch from a close distance on the beach as the sun slowly sets beside the lighthouse.The second location is on the island???s east coast, opposite the lighthouse, at Ox-Head Hill. To get there, one must first walk along a path to a commanding point at the top of the hill. From here, it is possible to see the setting sun in all its glory as it disappears into the ocean???s horizon, with a wholly unobstructed view of the twilight sky.Whether you view the sunset from Green Island Lighthouse or at Ox-Head Hill, anyone who sees it with their own eyes cannot fail to be moved by the beautiful sight of Nature in all its splendor. Furthermore, since the entrance to the trail that leads to Ox-Head Hill is not clearly signposted, many visitors pass it by, which means that it has become a kind of secret viewing spot.Those who wish to view the sunset at Ox-Head Hill should slow down after driving past the Guanyin Cave; if you look carefully over your right shoulder, you will find the entrance to the path, surrounded by wooden fencing. The best time to view the sunset during summertime is late afternoon around 5pm. Don???t forget to arrive early and wait to be sure you don???t miss that special moment when the sun melts into the island???s coastline.(Liberty Times, translated by Edward Jones)?????¢X??????????????????????????????????????¢F???????????¡Â???????????????????????¢D??????????????¡Â???????????¢G?¢F?????????¡Â?????????????¡±?????????¢D?????¢X????????????????????¡Â???????¢D?????????????????????????????????¢F??¡Â??¢D???????????????????¡P???¢F????????¢X????????¢F??¢F?????????????????????TODAY???S WORDS?????¢D??????1.  must-see scenic spot      n. phr.????????¡Â???(bi4 you2 jing2 dian3)2. lighthouse      n.??????(deng1 ta3)3. commanding point      n. phr.?????????(zhi4 gao1 dian3)4. coastline      n.??¡P????¡P?(hai3 an4 xian4?????????????????¡Â????????¡Ó???????????????????¢X??????????????¡Ó¡Ó???????????????????????¢D?????¢X??¢X???????????????????¢D???????????????????????¢X¡Ó????????¢X??????????????????????¡Â??????????????????????????¡P??¡P?????????????????????¡Ó?????¡P?????¢F??????????????¡Â????????????????????¡Â???????¡Ó¡Ó????????¢D??¡Â?¡±?????????????????????????????????????????¡P¡Ó?????¡±???????????¡Â???????????????????????¡Ó??????????¡Ó¡Ó??¢D??¢G??????????????¡Â????¡P¡Â?????????????????¢F??¢X??????????????¡Â????????????????¢G????????¡±??¢F????????¡±???¡Â???????????¢X???????¡Ó¡Ó????????¢D????????????????¡±??????????????????¢X?????¢F??????????????????????????¢X??¡±????¢X¡Ó??¡Â??¢D?????¢X??¡Ó????????????????????¢D??¢G????????¢G????????¢D?????????????????¡Â?????????????¡P??????????????????????????¡±???¡Â?????????????????¢D?????¢D????????¡P????¡P??????¢G??????(?????¡Ó?????¡Ó????????????)",1

Precinct polivr had Liu under surveillance for some time because he was suspected of heading a narcotics ring and using drugs to recruit addicts to be dealers, it said.Officers tried to apprehend him yesterday morning after an arrest warrant was issued, the department said.Liu resisted arrest and fled toward Jhonghe with the police in pursuit, leading to a firefight on the streets in which 30 shots were exchanged, police said.Liu then entered a residence on Lane 410, Jingsin Street (??¡Â??¢X???), it said.The police officers who had been pursing Liu retreated some distance from the building and a SWAT team was called in to cordon off the alley and warn local residents before negotiations began, the department said.Liu supposedly had a grenade in addition to guns and threatened to commit suicide during the negotiations.He also demanded to see his girlfriend, who police escorted to the scene to talk with Liu after putting body armor on her.After three hours of negotiations, Liu laid down his weapons and surrendered, police said.Liu is also a suspect in several violent crimes reportedly connected to urban development projects in Taipei???s Zhongshan District (????¡Ó¡Ó) and the attempted blackmail of a man surnamed Shao (???) for NT$3 million (US$99,279), police said.During the standoff, the police department???s priority was protecting bystanders and local residents, and triple security lines were established to keep residents from being taken hostage, Criminal Investigation Corps Commander Liao Hsun-cheng (?????????) said.New Taipei City Police Department Commissioner Hu Mu-yuan (?????????) said Liu had apparently acted out of fear of facing 18 years or more in prison for resisting arrest, drugs and other charges.Officers talking with Liu kept telling him that he would not be sentenced to life in prison or to death and that he would be likely to receive parole if he behaves well in prison, Hu said.A prosecutor who was also at the scene told Liu that he would be treated with leniency if he surrendered, Hu said.Meanwhile, a family member of murdered former Taoyuan county commissioner Liu Pang-yu (?????????) yesterday denied that Liu Pang-cheng was a cousin of the dead man, as some local media reports had claimed.Liu Pang-yu???s family lived in Taoyuan???s Jhongli (????¢G¢F) and Pingjhen (??????) districts, and although there are many people in the generation who carry the word Pang (???) in their given names, no one by the name Liu Pang-cheng is known to the family, the relative said.The family deeply mourns Liu Pang-yu and does not wish to see his reputation or that of his relatives tarnished by erroneous information, the relative said.Liu Pang-yu and six others were killed in an execution-style slaying at his residence on Nov. 21, 1996, a case that was never solved.Additional reporting by Lee Jung-ping",1
362,Front Page,"Hundreds of migrant workers and members of labor rights groups yesterday took to the streets of Taipei on the eve of Workers??? Day to urge the government to amend the law to improve working conditions and labor rights for migrant workers.Participants rallied in front of the Ministry of Labor at about noontime, calling on the ministry to meet three main demands, before setting off on a parade that ended on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building.The marchers held signs and banners in several languages, with messages such as ???against the government being employer-friendly and using the system to suppress migrant workers,??? ???do not abuse, migrant workers are humans too??? and ???stop sweatshop migrant labor, fight for equal labor rights.???The parade organizer, the Taiwan International Workers??? Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2
363,Front Page,"The Philippines followed up an ASEAN summit by releasing a final communique yesterday that removed mention of international concerns over China???s ???militarization??? of newly built islands in the disputed South China Sea in a major concession to Beijing.The 25-page statement issued by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte following the day-long meeting of ASEAN leaders that he hosted in Manila also made no direct mention of his country???s landmark arbitration victory against China last year.A vague reference to the ruling was removed from a part of the communique that discussed the long-seething territorial conflicts and moved elsewhere in the document.The changes were apparent based on a previous draft of the communique seen by reporters.A foreign diplomat based in Manila said that the Philippines circulated a stronger draft statement to other ASEAN members, which was backed by countries like Vietnam.Other governments made suggestions, but Duterte, as ASEAN chairman this year, could decide how to shape the language of the regional bloc???s ???chairman???s statement,??? said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the issue publicly.China and ASEAN member states Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, along with Taiwan, have overlapping claims to territory in the South China Sea.ASEAN, which makes decisions by consensus, has previously struggled to come up with statements on the issue, with Duterte???s predecessor often pushing for a tougher tone against China and getting pushback from Cambodia and Laos, unwilling to upset their largest trading partner and most important economic benefactor.China has dismissed and ignored the arbitration ruling handed down in July last year, which invalidated most of its historic claims to almost all of the South China Sea.Since taking office in June last year, Duterte has taken a much softer stance on China and the disputes than his predecessor.That was reflected in yesterday???s watered-down communique, which three Philippine officials said came at the request of Chinese diplomats in Manila.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.Former Philippine officials who dealt with the disputes say Duterte???s concessions to China could weaken the ability of the Philippines and other ASEAN members to seek Chinese compliance to the arbitration ruling and curb Beijing???s increasingly assertive behavior.???Our government, in its desire to fully and quickly accommodate our aggressive northern neighbor may have left itself negotiating a perilous road with little or no room to rely on brake power and a chance to shift gears if necessary,??? former Philippine foreign secretary Albert del Rosario said.",1

McMaster, reassured his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-jin, that the US alliance with South Korea was its top priority in the Asia-Pacific region, the South Korean presidential office said.The conversation followed another North Korean missile test-launch on Saturday, which Washington and Seoul said was unsuccessful.Trump, asked about his message to North Korea after the latest missile test, told reporters: ???You???ll soon find out,??? but did not elaborate on what the US response would be.Trump???s comments in an interview on Thursday that he wanted Seoul to pay for the THAAD deployment perplexed South Koreans and raised questions about his commitment to the two countries??? alliance.South Korean officials responded that the cost was for Washington to bear, under the bilateral agreement.???National Security Adviser H.R.

Chan said on Facebook, referring to KMT Vice Chairman Hau Lung-bin (?????????), who said he would nominate Gou as the party???s presidential candidate if he is elected KMT chairman.Chan said the KMT should not cling to wishful thinking and rely on people outside of the party to win the next presidential election, because a last-minute refusal from the candidate could disrupt the party???s campaign strategy and result in the nomination of an unsuitable candidate.That could lead to a repeat of what happened in last year???s presidential election campaign, during which the KMT replaced its original candidate, KMT Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu (????¡±???¡Ó), with New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu (??¡Ó??????) only three months before the vote due to Hung???s falling approval rating, Chan said.Touting his friendship with Gou, Chan said he contacted the businessman last year for a loan when the KMT was facing financial difficulties after its bank accounts were frozen by the Executive Yuan???s Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.???The incident goes to show our [close] relationship. We have talked about the 2020 race before, but Gou should be the one answering the question??? about whether he wants to represent the KMT in the next presidential election, Chan said.Gou???s mother loaned the KMT NT$45 million (US$1.49 million) in October last year when the party was struggling to pay its employees.Gou last week attracted public attention after he was filmed walking out of the White House on Thursday and Friday during a trip to Washington to discuss a potential investment in the US.The White House yesterday confirmed that Gou on Friday briefly met with US President Donald Trump.Chan said the KMT should engage in self-reflection and explore ways to attract talent from various sectors of society to join the party.The party should propose policies that would touch the voters, instead of capitalizing on Gou???s influence, he added.However, the Facebook post was edited hours later to remove the parts about Chan asking Gou for a loan and Hau capitalizing on the businessman.Hau yesterday again pointed at Gou as the only person that stands a chance of defeating President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) in the next presidential election.???A party leader should be selfless and think about nothing but ???winning.???

Chang said.The government???s failure to allocate sufficient funds to official development assistance was a major obstacle to the nation???s efforts to convince other governments to support Taiwan in the WHO, he said.???We cannot attend the meetings empty-handed. Instead, we should have a compelling and professionally crafted cooperative strategy prepared after observing the needs of other nations and forming ties with their professionals,???

The DGH divided construction into three projects that were put up for tender.The first two, which involve building connecting roads at both sides of the bridge, were begun in October 2014 and January last year.However, the tender process for the construction of the main part of the bridge has failed three times, the DGH said.To facilitate the bidding process, the highway authority said that it is planning to raise the construction funds for the third project from NT$8.4 billion to NT$9.4 billion in the hopes of attracting qualified bidders at a tender session scheduled for May 23.The completion of the bridge would be set back until 2021 at the earliest, it said.The bridge, which is to be designed by London-based Zaha Hadid Architects, would be the world???s longest asymmetric cable-stayed bridge with a single pylon.Apart from car lanes, the highway authority said that it is to allocate space on the bridge for a light-rail system connecting New Taipei City???s Tamsui (?¡P??¢X?) and Bali (??????) districts.The Tamkang Bridge would help shorten the travel distance for people traveling between Tamsui and Bali by about 15km, shaving 25 minutes off their travel times.Travelers between the two  areas must now cross Guandu Bridge (????????¡±???) in Taipei???s Beitou District (??????).",1

Pomeroy said. ???These cities will start to play a bigger and bigger role in the world economy, and understanding what is going on there will be even more important.???That means policymakers will have to balance the upsides of urbanization ??? economies of scale, better productivity and infrastructure, chance encounters that lead to new ideas, better productivity and infrastructure ??? with the potential downsides, in the shape of increased crime, pollution and perpetually snarled traffic.If that does not happen, these ill effects could sap economic potential, Pomeroy said.The urban areas experiencing the biggest increase in population will probably be in Africa.Kigali, Rwanda???s capital, is expected to see its population of 1.3 million double in the next 15 years.To help prepare for that the city has developed a master plan for transportation and housing, with the aim of being a slum-free city.By 2030, 81 of the world???s 100 most populous cities are to be in emerging markets.",1

Rival airlines show little interest in buying it and creditors refuse to lend more money.Rome has thrown Alitalia a short-term lifeline, a bridging loan of up to 400 million euros to see it through a bankruptcy process, under which an administrator would decide if it can be sold as a going concern or should be liquidated.However, the government has ruled out renationalizing the former state-owned business struggling to compete at home against low-cost carriers Ryanair Holding PLC and EasyJet PLC.Italian Minister of Finance Pier Carlo Padoan has gone a step further, saying the government is unwilling, directly or indirectly, to invest any capital in it.",1
388,Business,"US President Donald Trump???s plans to slash corporate taxes in the US have sparked concerns of a new global fiscal race to the bottom, possibly involving a wave of negative social consequences, experts say.In what Trump???s economic adviser Gary Cohn described as ???the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986, and one of the biggest tax cuts in American history,??? the White House plans to dramatically cut taxes for US businesses and individuals, slashing the corporate tax from a top rate of 35 percent to 15 percent.The aim, according to US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, is to ???bring back trillions of [US] dollars that are offshore to be invested here in the United States??? and create jobs.Trump???s goal is for the reforms to propel the US economy to 3 percent annual growth.However, the long-anticipated overhaul ??? details of which remain unclear beyond a handful of headline measures ??? could face stiff opposition in the US Congress, including from some Republicans, with lawmakers sharply divided over the prospect of fuelling already-rising deficits.The plans have also raised eyebrows at non-governmental and non-profit organizations.They could accelerate ???the race to tax competition on an international level and all of us will pay the price,??? Oxfam spokeswoman Manon Aubry told reporters.???When the world???s most powerful country decides to slash tax revenues as much as this, a number of other countries may follow suit, bringing with it imbalances that will have enormous impacts on our societies,??? she said.Falling tax revenues would make it harder for governments to pay for welfare, healthcare and other benefits without going too deep into the red, she said.To make up the shortfall, governments could be tempted to hike valued-added tax, often criticized for placing a disproportionate tax burden on the less well-off, Aubry said.???The cut in corporate taxes in the US will fuel tensions between countries,??? said Jean-Pierre Lieb, a tax lawyer at consultants EY.Corporate taxes in the US are the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, followed by France with a rate of 34 percent, Belgium with 33 percent and Australia with 30 percent. The OECD average is about 24 percent.However, to become more attractive, a number of countries have decided to lower their corporate tax rates.Britain is planning to cut its rate from 20 percent to 17 percent in 2020, a decision that predates Trump???s move and was strongly prompted by fears that corporations might find the UK less attractive place after it leaves the EU.There were even plans to cut the rate to 15 percent to help with Brexit woes, British papers have reported, but British Prime Minister Theresa May appears to have ruled out such a deep cut for now.France, meanwhile, is poised to take its corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 28 percent in 2020.Other countries, including Italy and Israel, have similar ambitions.???What we???re seeing is a headlong rush??? said Lieb, pointing to the case of Hungary where the corporate tax rate is to be slashed from 19 percent to just 9 percent.However, even if Trump succeeds in pushing through his planned cuts, countries such as Ireland, which have used their low tax rates to woo foreign companies like Google and Apple Inc, still expect to remain attractive.",1

Alphabet gave the award to Pichai in January last year, a few months after he succeeded Larry Page as Google???s chief executive officer.

That is IBM???s lowest result since votes were first mandated for public companies in 2011.

391,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2
392,Editorials,"In February, former Executive Yuan director-general of personnel administration Chen Keng-chin (?????????) called on civil servants to ???milk their jobs??? and ???goof around??? as much as possible to drag down the government, but the nation???s chief executive, who should be the one most deeply insulted by Chen???s remark, said nothing.Protesters opposing pension reforms, who call themselves ???heroes,??? have been turning to violence and seem determined to take the nation down with them if their demands are not met, yet when police officers responsible for maintaining public order saw some of their retired former seniors among the rioters, they stood to attention and saluted.All the government???s talk of harshly punishing those who use violence is useless if the authorities appear so weak.In November last year, a group of retired generals went on a friendly visit to an enemy nation, where they sat and listened to instructions from that nation???s head of state and stood in respect for its national anthem ??? common sense and the Ministry of Defense???s own definition will tell you which enemy country we are talking about.Yet the commander-in-chief of Taiwan???s armed forces, who, again, should be the one most deeply insulted, had nothing to say.Living in today???s Taiwan, one often gets the feeling that important elements of the nation have gotten out of control, and it is hard to tell whether anyone is actually in charge.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???), who was elected by a majority, seems to be growing more and more distant from the public. Sadly, the public???s impression of her is that whenever she makes a speech, be it on a big or small occasion and no matter whether her speech is long or short, she is always clutching a script from which she reads every word without ever raising her eyes.When the speaker is uninspiring, the listener is uninspired. Tsai no longer shows any sign of her lively and friendly side, or of her wisdom as a prominent intellectual.National leaders??? success might stem from their verbal skill, their charisma, their good governance or their closeness to the public. How can Tsai put this nation back on its feet, establish democratic discipline and foster decent public behavior? I humbly and sincerely offer the following suggestions:First, the president should climb out of her ivory tower, meet people face to face and engage in frank and honest dialogue with her constituents.Second, she should greatly reduce the amount of ???state secrets.??? The more secrets there are, the more doubtful and suspicious the public will be. Most ???secrets??? are really unnecessary and only serve to satisfy the sense of superiority of a handful of people who have a monopoly on the information.The government should not just let the public know how things are, but also why things are the way they are. For example, what would be the harm in calling China ???China??? and Taiwan ???Taiwan????What harm would it do if the legislature passed a normal referendum law like those of other democratic nations? What harm would come from freezing or abolishing the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Taiwan Provincial Government? What negative impact could answering these questions possibly have on ???national security????Third, Taiwan could set a trend by doing something even advanced democracies have not done. Tsai could expand on the examples of former US presidents Franklin Roosevelt???s ???fireside chats??? and Ronald Reagan???s weekly presidential broadcasts by having national TV and radio stations set aside an hour every Sunday for a dialogue between the president and the public.",1
393,Editorials,"Two important bills have passed their third readings in the legislature. One was an amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act (????????????), passed on April 20, and the other was an amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act (?????¢F???????????????), which was passed on Tuesday. These two amendments have the same purpose: to secure financing for Taiwan???s long-term care services.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has exerted a great deal of effort in pushing the amendments and those aged 60 and older are certain to feel the benefits. However, looking at what kind of policies should be made a priority in terms of national development, this is policy for older people and it is less urgent than coming up with policies for the young.The two amendments originated with changes to the Long-Term Care Services Act (??¡P?????¡±??¡±?????????) passed last year, according to which long-term care should be financed by the tobacco, estate and gift taxes.The amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Act adds NT$20 (US$0.66) to the tax on every pack of cigarettes, which will now total NT$31.8 per pack. According to the government???s calculations, this will contribute NT$23.346 billion to long-term care every year.The amendment to the Estate and Gift Tax Act changes the tax rate from a flat 10 percent to a three-tiered incremental tax of 10, 15 and 20 percent. The government estimates that this would contribute NT$6.3 billion to long-term care per year.Two legislative sessions have passed since the DPP government took office and since these are the bills it has focused on, it is clear that they constitute its main policy focus.The increase in the tobacco tax is aimed at public health issues such as tobacco hazard prevention, something most people can agree with.However, the estate and gift tax adjustments set off a wave of calls to reduce taxes, after the government???s policy direction became clear last year. The calls have extended to calls for adjustment to the taxes on cash, shares, real estate and insurance.Since neither Singapore nor Hong Kong or the rest of China have an estate tax, there have even been examples of wealthy people voting with their feet to protect their property. Experience bears this out: After the estate tax was cut to 10 percent in 2009, the government???s fiscal revenue remained about the same as it was before the amendment, when the tax stood at 50 percent.In other words, this source of fiscal revenue is unstable and it is questionable if the Ministry of Finance???s estimates will be met. It will be necessary to pay attention to the effect this will have on capital.However, these issues are not the point of this editorial. Considering Taiwan???s problems, more attention should be given to policies aimed at the young instead of focusing on the elderly. At the very least, the two groups should be given the same weight.If priority is given to policies for the elderly, that could remove all room for policies for young people. That would be a great mistake.The danger posed to Taiwan by a falling birth rate and an aging population is common knowledge. Let us leave aside immigration policies for the moment and focus on these two issues alone.We cannot stop people from growing old or reduce the number of elderly people, so if we are to change the demographic structure, there is only one way to go: encouraging families to have children.",1
394,Editorials,"The nation???s economic achievements were once internationally renowned, but economic growth has widened the ever-expanding gap between rich and poor.The lack of a bicameral legislature, of effective supervision of the executive offices and of government oversight in balanced regional development has caused cities that once flourished economically to decline in administrative functionality simply because of their distance from the capital.As young people migrate to Taipei with the promise of higher salaries, other cities continue to become more marginalized.Take Pingtung for example: the nation???s southernmost city, which has seen a population reduction of 46,930 people since 2010. The political and economic center of Taipei has been unconcerned with the city at the island???s southern tip since the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) moved to Taiwan from China.Pingtung has received proportionally far fewer national resources than other large cities. Many people in the city are concerned that it is becoming increasingly lethargic and that they might soon lose a legislative representative, which would reduce the say of Pingtung???s people in the Legislative Yuan.In the absence of ???economic human rights??? and protection from the federal government under the constitutional system, the decline of Pingtung epitomizes the nation???s economic development.It is unfortunate that this phenomenon has failed to garner the attention of the media, which are mostly located in Taipei, making Pingtung???s unbalanced development even more invisible to officials in the capital.A group has filed a petition through the government petition platform for the high-speed railway to be extended to Pingtung (https://goo.gl/34qnUM).The petition as of yesterday had been signed by 6,055 people, reaching the platform???s threshold within a week, whereas typically only about 4.7 percent of petitions are able to meet the requirements.The strong voice of these people has gathered great interest and attention from Taiwanese. The Pingtung County commissioner, as well as several social activism groups, have echoed the petition???s call to raise awareness about the importance of communication construction in Pingtung.Pingtung residents have come together on this issue, hoping for more balanced regional development and equality in economic rights. They believe that the government???s investment in communication infrastructure would be an important symbol of the government???s willingness to improve regional imbalance and economic inequality.For decades, Taipei has been the prime subject of consideration for resources and government policies. It does not favor local industrial transformation and innovation when talent and resources are concentrated in metropolitan regions.As most corporate headquarters and funds are concentrated in Taipei, other regions are forced to face population loss, lack of funding for infrastructure and fewer employment opportunities.As the economies in these regions continue to suffer, the gap between rich and poor continues to increase. Such hardships would undoubtedly become long-term challenges for rural regions.It is therefore all the more critical to come up with strategies to face these challenges, to eliminate domestic inequality and opposition, and to form alliances with other nations on the basis of the common goal of attaining regional balance and equal opportunity for all.",1
395,Editorials,"At a time when South Korea is struggling to deter North Korea???s nuclear threats, human rights advocates say its military is targeting gay soldiers in its ranks.In recent weeks, the army has focused on dozens of those soldiers in what rights groups say is a campaign against gay men in the 620,000-member military.At least 32 have faced criminal charges of ???sodomy or other disgraceful conduct,??? according to the domestic news media and lawyers and rights advocates familiar with the cases.On Tuesday night, the issue of gay rights became a focus in South Korea???s presidential race, when the candidate who leads in the polls, Moon Jae-in, joined some of the other contenders in saying that he opposed homosexuality.Critics said the statement was a tactic to win support among conservative voters.Moon made the comment during a debate in which the issue of the military???s treatment of gays was raised. Under the conscript system, all eligible men are required to serve about two years.However, the Military Criminal Act outlaws sodomy and other unspecified ???disgraceful conduct??? between servicemen, whether or not there is mutual consent and whether or not that conduct takes place on military compounds. Those found to have violated the act face up to two years in prison.The army declined to provide details on its investigation.However, it said that it was not cracking down on gay soldiers; instead it said that it was trying to root out sodomy and other homosexual activities, which right-wing Christian groups have called a growing blight on its readiness to fight North Korea???s 1.2 million-member military.However, in the past week, evidence has emerged to support the allegations by gay soldiers that investigators flouted the army???s own regulations on how to treat gay service members by preying upon the soldiers??? fear of shame and abuse if they are outed in the military.Analysts and veterans said bullying, hazing and sexual violence were chronic problems in the South Korean army.In a series of telephone conversations secretly recorded in March and last month, an army investigator warned a gay sergeant against seeking help from lawyers or the National Human Rights Commission of Korea.In one conversation, the investigator complained that another gay soldier refused to cooperate with the inquiry and wanted to hire a lawyer.???If he hires a lawyer, that means he is outing himself,??? the investigator says in the recording, uploaded to the Web site of the Seoul-based Military Human Rights Center for Korea.It is unknown how many gay soldiers were punished under the anti-sodomy law before the recent flurry of charges.Gay soldiers said they feared that they were being scapegoated in the recent inquiry as part of an effort by the army to contain sexual abuse.In a survey of 671 veterans commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission in 2004, more than 15 percent said they had been sexually abused.Advocates say that by punishing gay soldiers, the government was sending the wrong message in South Korea, where the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are a largely taboo and politically unpopular subject. Powerful right-wing Christian groups have intensified a campaign against homosexuality, scuttling a bill that would have given sexual minorities the same protection as other minorities.",1

John Delury, an Asia expert and professor at Seoul???s Yonsei University, said of the US moves.Trump seemed to think he could pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons and, if that failed, would then consider a pre-emptive strike, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul???s Dongguk University.North Korea, for its part, was relatively restrained, analysts said.Yes, North Korea expressed anger, as it does every year, over annual springtime joint military exercises by Seoul and Washington that the North calls preparations for an invasion.However, its response did not go beyond what happens most years. That included bellicose threats, a [failed] missile test linked to the celebration of the birthday of North Korea???s founder Kim Il-sung and war games during the anniversary of the founding of the Korean People???s Army.NUCLEAR AND MISSILE TESTSA big part of North Korea???s past brinkmanship has always involved its weapons program.

Its popularity is also growing steadily in the other Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe, though the numbers are much smaller.Regional competition events are arranged and organized by volunteers throughout Finland, culminating in national championships every year.This year???s main event took place late this month at a packed sports hall in Helsinki, attracting an estimated 1,000 spectators to watch about 200 participants competing with their hobbyhorses in several subcategories.???It???s very bizarre for other people to see, for the first time especially, this kind of stuff,??? said Taija Turkki, an 18-year-old hobbyhorse coach. ???Because they think we think the horse is alive, which we do not. We understand that it???s dead, made of fabric and all that.???Lack of strict rules and pompous ceremonies, strong social media presence and female bonding are a big part of the attraction.???Freedom to create and imagination are key aspects into why people start hobby-horsing,??? said Aarniomaki, a hobbyhorse veteran who does not compete actively anymore, but is keen on organizing related events such as a recent hobbyhorse parade through the streets of Helsinki.",1

402,Sports,"It never happened in the decade when the prosaic nature of his heavyweight domination quite underwhelmed boxing, but, at the age of 41, Wladimir Klitschko on Saturday belatedly earned proper appreciation for his greatness.How ironic, though, that it had to come in defeat.The veteran Ukrainian warrior came agonizingly close to becoming only the second fighter after George Foreman to win a recognized version of the world title as a forty-something before being stopped by Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium in London.Bruised, battered and with a deep cut by his left eye, he could only reflect ruefully on having failed to follow up his sixth round knock-down of Joshua aggressively enough, feeling he had let the Briton off the hook.Yet, although a 14-year age gap and Joshua???s fitness, strength and power eventually saw him floored twice and finally rescued by the referee in the 11th round, Klitschko still felt like a winner at the end of an exhilarating evening.Ninety thousand fans at Wembley seemed to agree as the man who was so often damned with faint praise during 11 years of heavyweight dominance received much greater acclaim here than he had after many of his mundane victories.Often portrayed as being too safety-first and mechanical in approach, here was a very different ???Dr Steelhammer,??? stung into desperate defiance after Joshua had sent him crashing to his knees with a fifth-round assault.It looked for all money like the end for the man who had appeared well past his sell-by-date in a sorry dethroning at the hands of Tyson Fury some 17 months earlier, but as Klitschko himself said: ???I took a beating, but I recovered well.???Indeed, in what was perhaps the most courageous couple of minutes in his two-decade professional career, Klitschko fought back dazzlingly, one big left hook setting up a counter-attack so ferocious that by the end of the round it was Joshua who was looking almost out on his feet.After following up with a booming right cross in the next which saw Joshua felled for the first time in his professional career, Klitschko made what he felt was a crucial, fight-turning error.???I thought he wouldn???t get up. Big respect to AJ. From that moment, I think I should have done more straight after he went down,??? he said. ???But I was pretty sure it was going to be my night so I took my time.???Big mistake. Joshua was given a breather and when he clawed his way back in the later stages, finding a ???second wind,??? his wicked body shots began to sap Klitschko???s stamina, setting up the painful denouement.As the Wembley crowd cheered him afterward, though, Klitschko started to appreciate that the historic contest had elevated the reputations of all involved.???I think Joshua and I both did great, I think we did a lot for the sport in the way we performed and how we respected and treated each other,??? he said. ???It was a great night for boxing and the fans. You will probably be surprised by my statement, but I don???t feel like I lost.??????Tonight, we all won. I didn???t get the belts but I didn???t feel like I lost ??? not my name, my face, nor my reputation. It was great to be involved in such an amazing occasion,??? Klitschko said.This did not sound like a man who was quite ready to hang up his gloves and he had not looked like one either as he often outboxed his old sparring partner, teaching Joshua more in one night than he had learned in his other 18 bouts combined.",1

His body has been recovered from the site and been taken to Lukla in Nepal, where the only airport in the Mount Everest area is located.It was not clear how Steck died, but he was planning to climb Mount Everest and nearby Mount Lhotse next month.He was the first casualty in the spring mountaineering season in Nepal that began last month and ends in May.Hundreds of foreign climbers are on the mountains to attempt scaling Himalayan peaks in May when there are a few windows of favorable weather.Steck was one of the most-renowned mountaineers of his generation.He was best known for his speed-climbing, including setting several records for ascending the north face of the Eiger, a classic mountaineering peak in the Bernese Alps in Switzerland, that he climbed in two hours and 47 minutes without using a rope.In 2013 he achieved the first solo climb of the Annapurna south face in Nepal after almost losing his life in a fall there in 2007. For that he received the Piolet d???Or ??? considered the Oscar of mountaineering ??? the following year.In 2015, Steck decided to climb all 82 peaks in the Swiss Alps higher than 4,000 meters traveling between mountains by foot, bike and paraglider only.He completed the feat in 62 days, helping cement his reputation as the ???Swiss Machine.???Steck said in an interview last month with Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger that he considered himself an ???outsider??? in the mountaineering scene because athletic achievement is more important to him than adventure.Asked about his upcoming Everest-Lhotse expedition, involving a quick climb from one peak to the other including an overnight in the death zone, Steck said: ???When I???m on Everest I can stop at any point. The risk is therefore quite small. For me it???s primarily a physical project. Either I get through, or I don???t have the strength for the whole traversal.???Asked what he would consider to be success on his expedition, Steck told Tages-Anzeiger: ???Of course I want to climb Everest and Lhotse, but that???s a very high goal. Failure for me would be to die and not come home.???",1

Lundqvist could not stop Jean-Gabriel Pageau, Ottawa???s unlikely hero.Pageau scored twice in the final four minutes of regulation to bring the Senators back from a two-goal deficit and capped the 6-5 comeback in the second overtime with his fourth goal of the game.???We played a strong game; we just came up a little bit short,??? a somber Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said.Ottawa has a two-games-to-none lead in this second-round series.Game 3 is played tomorrow in New York.Lundqvist and his teammates appeared to be headed for a series-tying win before Pageau ??? who scored only 12 goals in the regular season ??? notched his second goal of the game at 16 minutes, 41 seconds of the third period, then finished his hat trick at 18 minutes 58 seconds when Senators goalie Craig Anderson was pulled for an extra attacker.In the first overtime, the Rangers had a golden opportunity to escape with a victory when Rick Nash took the puck from Anderson behind the net.Nash had a chance to put it in, but it was poked away by Senators forward Kyle Turris.Nash???s squandered chance came after a stunning reversal in a third period that began with the Rangers seemingly assured of heading back to Madison Square Garden with the series tied at a game apiece.A strong second period had yielded three Rangers goals and a 4-2 lead, the kind that Lundqvist has been more than capable of defending.Michael Grabner opened the scoring for the Rangers with a short-handed goal at 4 minutes 16 seconds of the first, and Pageau tied the score with an unassisted goal at 13 minutes 59 seconds.The Rangers dominated the second period.Anderson had to make a flurry of early saves, stopping a frustrated J.T. Miller from close range with a virtual open net behind him.Miller, who has one assist and no goals in the playoffs, smacked his stick against the glass after he was denied.However, Chris Kreider ??? who made his Rangers debut during the 2012 first-round series against the Senators and also had been quiet in the playoffs ??? put his team ahead at 10 minutes 39 seconds off assists from Mika Zibanejad and Ryan McDonagh.Kreider shouted in delight as he celebrated his breakthrough moment along the boards.When he settled on the Rangers??? bench, Zibanejad, a former Senator, hugged him and planted a kiss on Kreider???s white helmet.Penguins 6, Capitals 2AP, WashingtonPhil Kessel scored twice, Sidney Crosby set up more goals and the Pittsburgh Penguins chased Braden Holtby on the way to a 6-2 victory over Washington Capitals in Game 2 that gave them a commanding 2-0 lead in their second-round series.Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 34 of the 36 shots he faced for Pittsburgh, which also got goals by Matt Cullen, Jake Guentzel and Evgeni Malkin.The Penguins scored three goals on 14 shots on Holtby, who was pulled in favor of Philipp Grubauer after the second period.",1

May told the BBC.May also reaffirmed her position that she would be prepared to walk away from the talks on leaving the EU without a deal if she did not like what was on offer from Brussels.At the Brussels summit, which was marked by unusual harmony among the 27 leaders, there was a flash of the cross-Channel acrimony which some fear could wreck any deal when officials accused London of cynically vetoing some EU spending and demanded it back down or face disrupting the start of talks next month.Meeting for the first time since May triggered the two-year countdown to Brexit in late March, her counterparts took just minutes as they sat down to lunch in Brussels to approve eight pages of negotiating guidelines hammered out by their diplomats over the past month.They greeted the decision with applause, officials said.The text will bind Michel Barnier, their chief negotiator, to seek a deal that secures the rights of 3 million EU expatriates living in Britain, ensures London pays tens of billions of euros Brussels thinks it will be owed, and avoids destabilizing peace by creating a hard EU-UK border across the island of Ireland.???We are ready,???

In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city???s federal plaza to Trump Tower.???We are here because there is no Planet B,??? the Reverend Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told a rally in Boston.The demonstrations came one week after supporters of science gathered in 600 cities around the globe, alarmed by political and public rejection of established research on topics including climate change and the safety of vaccines.Participants on Saturday said they object to Trump???s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things.Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame.Among those attending the Chicago rally were members of the union representing US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees.Trump has proposed cutting the EPA???s budget by almost one-third, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs.American Federation of Government Employees Council 238 president John O???Grady called the march ???a chance to speak out in unity against this administration??? and its ???ridiculous gutting of the EPA budget and staffing.???More than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta.

409,World News,"Faced with exploding populations and steadily rising temperatures worldwide, cities must make haste in reinforcing defenses against climate change-induced flooding and heat waves, experts said last week.City temperatures are forecast to shoot up in the coming years, exposing inhabitants to killer heat spikes, while rising sea levels and river flooding threaten homes, drinking water, and transport and electricity infrastructure.Cities are vulnerable to a unique risk called the ???urban heat island??? (UHI) effect ??? their concrete surfaces retain more of the sun???s heat than undeveloped areas, scientists said at a meeting in Vienna of the European Geosciences Union (EGU).By midcentury, if planet-warming fossil fuel emissions continue unabated, city temperatures in Belgium could exceed today???s heat-alert levels by as much as 10?C for 25 days each summer, according to one research paper.Another study showed that heat waves will become a frequent challenge for European cities ??? more numerous in the south of the continent, more intense in the north.Floods, a major risk to Europe???s dense urban settlements, will become more common because of an increase in freak rainstorms, as well as sea-level increases caused by polar ice melt and warmer ocean water expanding.In flood-prone Southeast Asia, precipitation is set to increase by 20 percent this century, one researcher said in Vienna.The stakes are especially high given the projections for expansion of urban areas, which are often ill equipped to deal with nature???s vengeance.Already, more than half the world???s population live in cities. By 2050, 80 percent of people in rich nations, and 60 percent in developing states, will be concentrated in built-up areas, according to recent calculations.This corresponds to the appearance of a settlement of 1 million inhabitants somewhere on the globe every week for the next 40 years.Occupying only a small portion of Earth???s available land, cities are responsible for 80 percent of all energy consumed and generate more than 60 percent of the planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted when humans burn fossil fuel for heating, power and transportation.In spite of efforts to curb emissions, the planet has already warmed about 1?C on average from pre-Industrial Revolution levels.Many scientists say the planet may be on track for 3?C of warming or more, exceeding the 2?C cap politicians set in Paris in 2015.This means cities must act now to shore up their defenses against impacts that can no longer be avoided, French climatologist Herve le Treut said at the annual EGU gathering.???It???s already happening,??? Le Treut said of climate change impacts. ???We have to start structural action quickly: transportation, houses... mainly in the cities, especially in vulnerable places.???Most of the infrastructure constructed by humanity is in urban zones.???The ways cities are built is not optimal??? for today???s climate reality, said Daniel Schertzer, a hydrometeorologist at the engineering school Ecole des Ponts ParisTech.???Historically, humans have settled near water, thinking of its usefulness, but not of the risk! Cities were conceived without taking geophysics into consideration, now they are discovering that nature is complicated, not just good,??? he said on the sidelines of the conference.Paris, for example, is due for its next so-called one-in-a hundred-year flood. The last major Paris flood, in 1910, saw the Seine river rise 8.62m, shutting down much of the City of Light???s basic infrastructure.",1

413,Features,"A museum can be a showcase for just about anything, it seems. The Museum of Ice Cream will take you through a fantasy world of sprinkles and gooey chocolate topping. Visitors to the Museum of Sex in New York City meander through the artifacts of erotic life and history.Do you want to unburden yourself of the pain of a broken heart? You can, the Museum of Broken Relationships suggests, by visiting its curated collections in Los Angeles or Zagreb, Croatia, of mementos donated anonymously by people who share similar feelings of love gone bad.Now, for people interested in why some gadgets have ended up on the garbage heap of product history, Samuel West, an organizational psychologist, has created the Museum of Failure.The museum will open in Helsingborg, Sweden, on June 7 with a curated collection of more than 60 products that, the museum Web site says, can provide insight into the ???risky business of innovation.??? Nine objects from the museum are on tour, stopping in Miami, Berlin and Amsterdam.Its curators will guide visitors through displays ???related to failure??? at no cost. ???How about a failed gourmet tasting menu at a fancy restaurant? Or a tasting of failed brews from regional microbreweries???? the Web site says. ???We welcome any further suggestions. The crazier the better.???Some of the products that West, its chief curator, calls studies in failure include Harley-Davidson fragrance; Bic pens made especially for women (???Yes, that???s right: lady-pens,??? said a Forbes review); and Coca-Cola Blak, a coffee-inspired drink.???The purpose of the museum is to show that innovation requires failure,??? West said as he introduced some of the exhibits in a video posted this month on the YouTube channel of Fredrik Skavlan, a Scandinavian talk show host. ???If you are afraid of failure, then we can???t innovate.??? He said he started the museum ???to encourage organizations to be better at learning from failures ??? not just ignoring them and pretending they never happened.??????TOTAL FLOP???West held up a Bic for Her pen, still in its package. ???Of course women can???t use pens for men; big failure,??? he said sarcastically.Harley-Davidson perfume? ???Total flop,??? he said, showing the box.Google Glass? The product collided with privacy issues, he contended. ???The cafes in the San Francisco area said they didn???t want people walking in and filming their customers,??? he said in an interview Friday.West characterized the Segway as a ???catastrophic??? failure that fell short of expectations to revolutionize transportation. ???Now it???s a silly device for kids or for company team-building activities,??? he said.West said the idea for the museum dawned on him when he visited the Museum of Broken Relationships. ???I couldn???t believe they had a Museum of Broken Relationships,??? he said. ???Then I decided I had to get busy with my Museum of Failure.???Vinnova, a Swedish innovation agency, provided funds to start the project, West said. In addition to starting the museum, West, 43, is an innovation researcher at Lund University. He has a doctorate in organizational psychology and advises companies on how to become more innovative and successful by embracing failure.???All the literature is obsessively focused on success, but 80 to 90 percent of innovations actually fail,??? he said. ???Why don???t these failures get the attention they actually deserve????",1
414,Features,"Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, is launching a new online publication which will aim to fight fake news by pairing professional journalists with an army of volunteer community contributors.Wikitribune plans to pay for the reporters by raising money from a crowdfunding campaign.Wales intends to cover general issues, such as US and UK politics, through to specialist science and technology.Those who donate will become supporters, who in turn will have a say in which subjects and story threads the site focuses on. And Wales intends that the community of readers will fact-check and subedit published articles.Describing Wikitribune as ???news by the people and for the people,??? Wales said: ???This will be the first time that professional journalists and citizen journalists will work side-by-side as equals writing stories as they happen, editing them live as they develop, and at all times backed by a community checking and rechecking all facts.???Although the site is launching at the beginning of the UK general election campaign, Wales said the impetus for the project came from the US.???Someone I know convinced me to give Trump 100 days before making my mind up,??? he said, ???but then on day one Kellyanne Conway came out and said her ???alternative facts??? line. That was when I really decided to move forward.???If the fundraising campaign goes well, Wales hopes to be able to hire the site???s first journalists ???as soon as possible??? ??? perhaps before June 8, when Britons vote in the general election called by prime minister Theresa May.Like Wikipedia, Wales???s new project will be free to access. The publication is launched last month with a crowdfunding campaign pre-selling monthly ???support packages??? to fund the initial journalists. The first issue will follow soon after.The community contributors will play a key part in the new site, ensuring that the content of the articles are always supported by as much extra information shared with the readers as possible.They will be backed up by a presumption of transparency in the site???s reporting, with journalists sharing full transcripts, video and audio of interviews.He hopes that a combination of the distributed intelligence of Wikipedia and measured professional journalism driven by a business model ???that???s not about chasing clicks??? will lead to a news organization built from the ground up to combat fake news and political rabble-rousing.There is a third way, he said, between the two models ???of he said, she said faux neutrality, or having a Paul Dacre [editor of the Daily Mail] agenda and ramming things down our throats.???He added: ???If you take a look at Wikipedia, it???s noisy and not a perfect place, but for true fake news, there???s been almost no impact on the Wikipedia community.???The volunteers are experienced enough to know it???s nonsense, and have an ethos saying: ???No, we???re here for neutral facts???: that community knows it from the ground up.???Those contributors who also support the site financially will eventually be able to advise on the topics they want Wikitribune to explore, Wales said.???If you take as an example the bitcoin community, they???re a very active and obsessed community.???There???s a lot of news that comes out in the field, and I think they???d love to be able to raise money to hire a journalist and put them on the bitcoin/blockchain beat.???",1

420,Front Page,"US lawmakers yesterday unveiled a huge US$1 trillion-plus spending bill that would fund most government operations through September, but would deny US President Donald Trump money for a border wall and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs.The 1,665-page bill agreed to on Sunday is the product of weeks of negotiations. It was made public in the predawn hours yesterday and is tentatively scheduled for a House of Representatives vote tomorrow.The catchall spending bill would be the first major piece of bipartisan legislation to advance during Trump???s short tenure in the White House. While losing on funding for the wall along the US-Mexico border, Trump won a US$15 billion down payment on his request to strengthen the military, though that too fell short of what he requested.The measure funds the remainder of the current fiscal year, through Sept. 30, rejecting cuts to popular domestic programs targeted by Trump, such as medical research and infrastructure grants.Successful votes later this week would also clear away any remaining threat of a government shutdown ??? at least until the Oct. 1 start of the 2018 budget year.Trump has submitted a partial 2018 budget promising a US$54 billion, 10 percent increase for the Pentagon from current levels, financed by cutting to foreign aid and other nondefense programs by an equal amount.However, negotiators rejected a smaller US$18 billion package of cuts and instead slightly increased funding for domestic programs.Democrats were quick to praise the deal.???This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table,??? said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat and a key force in the talks. ???The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren???t used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle class relies on, like medical research, education and infrastructure.???However, some Republican conservatives were wary.???I think you???re going to see conservatives have some real concerns with this legislation,??? US Representative Jim Jordan said on CNN, citing domestic spending obtained by Democrats and other issues. ???We told [voters] we were going to do a short-term spending bill that was going to come due at the end of April so that we could fight on these very issues, and now it looks like we???re not going to do that.???The measure is assured of winning bipartisan support in votes this week; the House and Senate have until midnight on Friday to pass the measure to avert a government shutdown.Democrats played a strong hand in the talks since their votes are needed to pass the bill, even though Republicans control both the White House and Congress. As a result, the measure does not look much different than the deal that could have been struck on former US president Barack Obama???s watch.",1

Lim said, calling on the government to consider pushing for a ???more normal and natural??? way of participating.The majority of Taiwanese do not understand why Beijing will not allow Taiwan to take part even as an observer in non-political organizations, such as the WHA, Lee said.If Beijing understood Taiwanese???s feelings, it would discard its old way of thinking and approach the issue with a new attitude, he said.The government has a backup plan in case it is not invited, Lee said, without providing details.The meeting???s main topic of discusion was the ???new framework??? for Taiwan-US relations approved by Tsai last month.The extensive vacancies related to East Asian Policy within the US executive branch is ???definitely a problem,??? Lee said, citing a member of a US-based think tank who said the US supports Taiwan???s participation in the WHA, but lacks officials to implement the policy.Numerous political appointments in the US Department of State, Department of Defense and Department of Commerce remain vacant several months into US President Donald Trump???s presidency, he said.???Right now we absolutely cannot find anyone who can hold talks with us,??? he said, adding that any talk of importing US pork or pushing for the ???new framework,??? aimed at increasing the frequency and level of official contact between Taiwan and the US, would have to wait until those vacancies are filled.",1

Shih said.However, there is no immediate plan to conduct hearings to determine CARES??? status ??? a necessary step to make any formal recognition of the organization???s link with the KMT, she said.CARES??? use of state-owned properties should be handled by the National Property Administration, while the committee is responsible for illicitly acquired assets of political parties and their affiliates, she said.The CARES staff was allowed to combine their years of service in the organization and the government to qualify for pensions ??? a privilege given to members of the KMT and some organizations founded by the party ??? but that alone could not be used to substantiate a link between the KMT and CARES, Shih said.The committee???s priority in the second half of this year would be finalizing its investigations into Central Investment Co (??????????????????), Hsinyutai Co (??¢G?¢G???¢X), the National Women???s League, the China Youth Corps, Broadcasting Corp of China and Central Motion Picture Corp to determine their relationship to the KMT, she added.",1

426,Taiwan News,"Minister Without Portfolio Audrey Tang (??????), a computer prodigy and entrepreneur who taught herself programming at age eight, says she is a ???civic hacker??? who, like a locksmith, uses specialized skills to help rather than harm.Appointed by leaders hoping to better connect with young voters who helped sweep President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) into office last year, 35-year-old Tang is using her expertise to more directly involve the public in policymaking and to counter ???fake news.??????Just by getting people to listen to the ideas that they don???t like, basically, develops their immune systems,??? Tang said last month in an interview while visiting Seoul for the annual Codegate international hacking competition.???If people have already considered carefully even the position of people they don???t agree with, they already have some kind of inoculation in their mind, so that they will not fall victim to rumors,??? she said.One of Tang???s initiatives is an artificial intelligence-powered system called Pol.is that aggregates and shares public views on policy issues to help determine the exact degree of support for a particular position.The government can use that data, for example, in negotiations over regulating Uber and other taxi services, Tang said.The approach reflects an effort to encourage deep thinking and listening on a mass scale, unlike the fragmented and ???half-baked??? ideas often found in social media posts, said Ming-Yeh Rawnsley, a research associate at the Centre of Taiwan Studies, SOAS, University of London.???It is important that [the] Taiwanese government is thinking about practicing deliberative democracy,??? Rawnsley said. ???While the explosion of social media platforms creates many exciting opportunities for public expression and mass participation, it also leads to a phenomenon where everyone wants to talk, but few care to listen.???Tang???s digital-friendly stance includes allowing top-level computer game players in the nation to serve an alternative form of compulsory military service. That gives professional e-sports League of Legends players the same opportunities an Olympics medalist would get.Next year, she plans to introduce classes on ???information technology and media literacy??? for all school years to help students learn to distinguish rumors and falsehoods from facts.???The idea is not about spotting ???fake news,??? but about being able to make decisions ... so that people don???t get swayed in one way or another based on rumors,??? Tang said.Taiwanese are keen on online forums like Twitter, whose 140-character limit for posts favors writing in Chinese characters that often can say more with fewer characters than in English.Tang objected to the term ???fake news,??? saying it is unfair to journalists.However, she said she finds US President Donald Trump???s enthusiastic use of Twitter ???refreshing.???Trump???s short declarations, though often surprising, leave little leeway for misinterpretation, she said.???If I make all my messages self-contained and short, then there???s no danger of being taken out of context. That???s the basic thing I???ve learned,??? Tang said. ???@realDonaldTrump uses Twitter ... the way it is meant to be??? used, she said.Tang is the nation???s first transgender government minister, a rarity especially in East Asia, where outspoken conservative groups often publicly condemn sexual minorities.",1

I felt like I had no time to adjust the uniform.

Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2

632,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,??? DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (?????????) said.???The founding philosophy of the WHA is health for all, but the reality is health for all except for Taiwanese,??? Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation.

Wang said.There should be no preconditions for WHA membership, and using membership as political leverage runs counter to the principles on which the WHO is founded, Lo said.Taiwan is an important contributor to global immunization and disaster relief, and the nation???s health insurance system ensures quality and affordable healthcare to all citizens, which has been closely studied by governments and international medical bodies, DPP Legislator and TMA president Chiu Tai-yuan (??¡Ó??¢X???) said.Taiwan is ranked first in Asia and sixth in the world in terms of palliative care, and this global leader in healthcare and medicine should not be excluded from the WHA for political reasons, Chiu said.China has also attempted to pressure the World Medical Association (WMA) to rename the TMA the ???Taiwan China Medical Association,??? TMA secretary-general Wang Bi-sheng (?????????) said.The Chinese association issued a written request during the WMA general assembly in Zambia last month for the name change, but the request was rejected because WMA members understood that the TMA is a non-political body and the issue should not be treated politically, Wang said.???China had made informal proposals to change the name of the TMA, but it was the first time it issued a written request.

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,???

879,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

939,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature.

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,??? DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (?????????) said.???The founding philosophy of the WHA is health for all, but the reality is health for all except for Taiwanese,??? Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation. Is the KMT speaking for China or Taiwan???? Wang said.There should be no preconditions for WHA membership, and using membership as political leverage runs counter to the principles on which the WHO is founded, Lo said.Taiwan is an important contributor to global immunization and disaster relief, and the nation???s health insurance system ensures quality and affordable healthcare to all citizens, which has been closely studied by governments and international medical bodies, DPP Legislator and TMA president Chiu Tai-yuan (??¡Ó??¢X???) said.Taiwan is ranked first in Asia and sixth in the world in terms of palliative care, and this global leader in healthcare and medicine should not be excluded from the WHA for political reasons, Chiu said.China has also attempted to pressure the World Medical Association (WMA) to rename the TMA the ???Taiwan China Medical Association,??? TMA secretary-general Wang Bi-sheng (?????????) said.The Chinese association issued a written request during the WMA general assembly in Zambia last month for the name change, but the request was rejected because WMA members understood that the TMA is a non-political body and the issue should not be treated politically, Wang said.???China had made informal proposals to change the name of the TMA, but it was the first time it issued a written request. It is expected that China will make another formal request at the general assembly in October,??? Wang said.",2

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,??? Natixis Securities analyst Georges Dieng said. ???We think there was room for a more upbeat message.???Research-and-development costs jumped 35 percent to 1.32 billion euros during the quarter.

1186,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature.

1354,Business,"Taiwan???s notebook shipments in the first quarter rose 6.3 percent year-on-year, their first uptick since the final quarter of 2014, the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC, ??¢F?¢D??????¡Ó?????????) said on Friday.The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc???s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (??¡Ó??????) said.Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said.Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said.Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight  designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year???s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays.Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China.A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said.The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand.Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed.While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc???s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp???s Kraby Lake, the institute said.However, AMD???s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said.The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses.As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.",2
1386,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,???

1551,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2
1756,Front Page,"A legislative review of draft acts to reform the civil servants??? pension plan reached some conclusions yesterday despite brawls and procedural disruptions.Several clauses of the draft acts proposed by the Examination Yuan, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the New Power Party and the People First Party were agreed upon during a meeting of the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee yesterday.There was an extensive debate over the base figure for the calculation of income replacement rate, the minimum pension level, pension contribution rates, parental benefits and the government responsibility for pension payment.The base figure for the calculation of the income replacement rate was determined to be ???two times a civil servant???s basic salary,??? but the committee did not decide on the minimum pension level, saying that it should be decided upon in cross-caucus negotiations.The committee also did not reach consensus on how much the government should help civil servants taking parental leave in paying for their pension premiums to boost the nation???s falling birth rate.A fight erupted between DPP and Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers after DPP Legislator Tuan Yi-kang (????????¡P), a co-convener of the committee, rejected the KMT caucus??? request to have Ministry of Justice officials attend the meeting to provide legal advice on the wording of a clause because Legislative Research Bureau officials were already in attendance.KMT lawmakers stormed the podium, and tempers flared as KMT Legislator Yosi Takun (?????????) scuffled with Tuan as he tried to seize Tuan???s microphone.The meeting was adjourned for nearly an hour until a ministry official arrived.Even before that, KMT lawmakers had tried to delay the discussion, first with a series of procedural maneuvers and then a series of extended speeches that took up most of the morning.The seven motions raised by the KMT caucus included ending the review at 5:30pm to prevent Legislative Yuan staff having to work overtime on Workers??? Day; postponing the review until the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan report to the legislature on pension issues; that the government announce long-term reform plans to keep the pension funds afloat for at least 30 years; and for a constitutional interpretation to be sought on conflicting reform proposals.The DPP majority on the committee was able to reject the KMT motions.Saying that it did not oppose the reform, the KMT said the principle of legitimate expectation needed to be recognized.Some of the proposals might breach legitimate expectations, as civil servants ???decided to take government jobs under the presumption that they would be entitled to retirement benefits guaranteed by the existing system,??? KMT Legislator Lin Te-fu (?????¡P???) said.",2
1778,Business,"Taiwan???s notebook shipments in the first quarter rose 6.3 percent year-on-year, their first uptick since the final quarter of 2014, the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC, ??¢F?¢D??????¡Ó?????????) said on Friday.The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc???s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (??¡Ó??????) said.Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said.Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said.Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight  designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year???s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays.Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China.A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said.The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand.Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed.While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc???s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp???s Kraby Lake, the institute said.However, AMD???s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said.The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses.As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.",2
1810,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,??? DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (?????????) said.???The founding philosophy of the WHA is health for all, but the reality is health for all except for Taiwanese,??? Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation. Is the KMT speaking for China or Taiwan???? Wang said.There should be no preconditions for WHA membership, and using membership as political leverage runs counter to the principles on which the WHO is founded, Lo said.Taiwan is an important contributor to global immunization and disaster relief, and the nation???s health insurance system ensures quality and affordable healthcare to all citizens, which has been closely studied by governments and international medical bodies, DPP Legislator and TMA president Chiu Tai-yuan (??¡Ó??¢X???) said.Taiwan is ranked first in Asia and sixth in the world in terms of palliative care, and this global leader in healthcare and medicine should not be excluded from the WHA for political reasons, Chiu said.China has also attempted to pressure the World Medical Association (WMA) to rename the TMA the ???Taiwan China Medical Association,??? TMA secretary-general Wang Bi-sheng (?????????) said.The Chinese association issued a written request during the WMA general assembly in Zambia last month for the name change, but the request was rejected because WMA members understood that the TMA is a non-political body and the issue should not be treated politically, Wang said.???China had made informal proposals to change the name of the TMA, but it was the first time it issued a written request. It is expected that China will make another formal request at the general assembly in October,??? Wang said.",2

1940,Front Page,"The Executive Yuan yesterday approved two draft amendments to reduce pension benefits for political appointees and public employees, with the drafts outlining larger pension cuts than the Examination Yuan???s versions.The Executive Yuan approved a draft amendment to the Act Governing the Recompense for the Discharge of Special Political Appointees (?????????????????¡P???????¢F????) and a draft amendment to the Civil Servant and Teacher Insurance Act (?????????????????????), which differed from the amendments proposed by the Examination Yuan, although they all seek to phase out an 18 percent preferential savings rate for retired public employees, lower the income replacement rate, extend the retirement age and increase pension premium rates.In terms of retirement benefits for political appointees, the Executive Yuan???s amendment would lower the income replacement ratio by 15 percentage points over 15 years. The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

1964,Business,"BMW AG yesterday stuck to a conservative profit forecast as chief executive Harald Krueger seeks patience to push through a transition to self-driving, electric cars.While rival Daimler AG upgraded its target to a ???significant??? gain this year, BMW kept its goal of a ???slight??? increase in earnings, according to a statement from the Munich-based company.BMW is to focus on its higher-end models in the coming years, including a new X7 sport utility vehicle (SUV), as it covers the steep costs of developing the vehicles of the future.???We expect start-up and marketing costs regarding new models to increase over the course of the year,??? BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,???

1975,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

The survey showed that the index rose to 104, up 1 point from a month earlier, the Taipei-based think tank said in a statement on Friday. The institute said the index could show steady growth for last month as the sector continues to benefit from rising consumption resulting from continued outbound sales growth.SMARTPHONESHTC revenue downHTC Corp (?????????) on Friday reported consolidated revenue of NT$4.71 billion (US$156 million) for last month, down 18.03 percent year-on-year and 9.4 percent month-on-month as demand for its smartphones remained weak. During the first four months of the year, HTC???s revenue totaled NT$19.24 billion, down 6.5 percent from a year earlier, the company???s filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange said.

2152,Editorials,"The government???s months-long talk of setting up a state investment corporation to promote, manage and finance emerging industries while addressing certain industrial concerns is likely to bear fruit soon.According to media reports last week, Premier Lin Chuan (??????) approved the appointment of former vice premier Wu Rong-i (?????????) as the corporation???s chairman. Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations. It also provides an opportunity for the nation to develop talented people that have strong investment expertise and an ability to help supervise fledgling companies.However, first the corporation will need to have a clear idea about what local industries need and what it can offer. It must also recruit a strong management team with access to potential investors.",2

The URABat was honored in the Energy & Sustainability/Power Source category at the awards.In the past two years, several private Taiwanese companies have been shortlisted for the awards, which were established in 1987. However this year is the first time that the ITRI has participated in the competition and been recognized with an award.Developed in collaboration with Stanford University since 2013, the URABat has achieved three breakthroughs, including finding the perfect combination of aluminum and graphite for the battery cell and making a battery cell that can be mass-produced for various needs and to various specifications.A 48V/1Ah aluminum battery installed in an electric bicycle for road tests acheived a full charge within 6 minutes, 20 times faster than conventional lead-acid batteries. The battery is made of highly stable graphite and aluminum materials and does not combust when damaged.The development of URABat was published in the journal Nature in 2015, and in 2016 it won the R&D; 100 Awards.???URABat is expected to offer a new power storage alternative that will have a huge impact on the world,??? said the head of the ITRI delegation, Dr. Yang Chang-chung, Deputy Division Director of ITRI???s Green Energy and Environment Research Labs.???There has never been a significant development in battery technology quite like the ITRI,??? commented Frank Bonafilia, executive director of the Edison Awards.TODAY???S WORDS ?????¢D??????1. rechargeable adj.??¡Â?????????

Day to urge the government to amend the law to improve working conditions and labor rights for migrant workers.Participants rallied in front of the Ministry of Labor at about noontime, calling on the ministry to meet three main demands, before setting off on a parade that ended on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building.The marchers held signs and banners in several languages, with messages such as ???against the government being employer-friendly and using the system to suppress migrant workers,??? ???do not abuse, migrant workers are humans too??? and ???stop sweatshop migrant labor, fight for equal labor rights.???The parade organizer, the Taiwan International Workers??? Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2

The court is to issue its final judgment at the end of this month, at which time New Balance could get damages.New Balance senior global corporate communications manager Amy Dow confirmed the penalty, saying the brand used by all five was called New Boom.Dow said New Balance sued under China???s anti-unfair competition law, because the country???s trademark laws ???currently provide slight loopholes for these brands to exist.??????These actions are significantly more costly than traditional counterfeit enforcement measures, but New Balance believes strongly in the protection of our intellectual property,??? she said.Chinese manufacturers copy everything about a product, but with a slight modification of the brand name.

2208,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2
2236,Front Page,"A legislative review of draft acts to reform the civil servants??? pension plan reached some conclusions yesterday despite brawls and procedural disruptions.Several clauses of the draft acts proposed by the Examination Yuan, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the New Power Party and the People First Party were agreed upon during a meeting of the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee yesterday.There was an extensive debate over the base figure for the calculation of income replacement rate, the minimum pension level, pension contribution rates, parental benefits and the government responsibility for pension payment.The base figure for the calculation of the income replacement rate was determined to be ???two times a civil servant???s basic salary,??? but the committee did not decide on the minimum pension level, saying that it should be decided upon in cross-caucus negotiations.The committee also did not reach consensus on how much the government should help civil servants taking parental leave in paying for their pension premiums to boost the nation???s falling birth rate.A fight erupted between DPP and Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers after DPP Legislator Tuan Yi-kang (????????¡P), a co-convener of the committee, rejected the KMT caucus??? request to have Ministry of Justice officials attend the meeting to provide legal advice on the wording of a clause because Legislative Research Bureau officials were already in attendance.KMT lawmakers stormed the podium, and tempers flared as KMT Legislator Yosi Takun (?????????) scuffled with Tuan as he tried to seize Tuan???s microphone.The meeting was adjourned for nearly an hour until a ministry official arrived.Even before that, KMT lawmakers had tried to delay the discussion, first with a series of procedural maneuvers and then a series of extended speeches that took up most of the morning.The seven motions raised by the KMT caucus included ending the review at 5:30pm to prevent Legislative Yuan staff having to work overtime on Workers??? Day; postponing the review until the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan report to the legislature on pension issues; that the government announce long-term reform plans to keep the pension funds afloat for at least 30 years; and for a constitutional interpretation to be sought on conflicting reform proposals.The DPP majority on the committee was able to reject the KMT motions.Saying that it did not oppose the reform, the KMT said the principle of legitimate expectation needed to be recognized.Some of the proposals might breach legitimate expectations, as civil servants ???decided to take government jobs under the presumption that they would be entitled to retirement benefits guaranteed by the existing system,???

2258,Business,"Taiwan???s notebook shipments in the first quarter rose 6.3 percent year-on-year, their first uptick since the final quarter of 2014, the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC, ??¢F?¢D??????¡Ó?????????) said on Friday.The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc???s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (??¡Ó??????) said.Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said.Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said.Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight  designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year???s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays.Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China.A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said.The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand.Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed.While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc???s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp???s Kraby Lake, the institute said.However, AMD???s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said.The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses.As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.",2
2290,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation.

2420,Front Page,"The Executive Yuan yesterday approved two draft amendments to reduce pension benefits for political appointees and public employees, with the drafts outlining larger pension cuts than the Examination Yuan???s versions.The Executive Yuan approved a draft amendment to the Act Governing the Recompense for the Discharge of Special Political Appointees (?????????????????¡P???????¢F????) and a draft amendment to the Civil Servant and Teacher Insurance Act (?????????????????????), which differed from the amendments proposed by the Examination Yuan, although they all seek to phase out an 18 percent preferential savings rate for retired public employees, lower the income replacement rate, extend the retirement age and increase pension premium rates.In terms of retirement benefits for political appointees, the Executive Yuan???s amendment would lower the income replacement ratio by 15 percentage points over 15 years. The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

2444,Business,"BMW AG yesterday stuck to a conservative profit forecast as chief executive Harald Krueger seeks patience to push through a transition to self-driving, electric cars.While rival Daimler AG upgraded its target to a ???significant??? gain this year, BMW kept its goal of a ???slight??? increase in earnings, according to a statement from the Munich-based company.BMW is to focus on its higher-end models in the coming years, including a new X7 sport utility vehicle (SUV), as it covers the steep costs of developing the vehicles of the future.???We expect start-up and marketing costs regarding new models to increase over the course of the year,??? BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,??? Natixis Securities analyst Georges Dieng said. ???We think there was room for a more upbeat message.???Research-and-development costs jumped 35 percent to 1.32 billion euros during the quarter. That hurt return on sales, which fell to 9 percent from 9.4 percent a year earlier.Unlike its competitors, BMW has chosen to add electric power trains to existing models rather than design specific electronic vehicles.

2455,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations. It also provides an opportunity for the nation to develop talented people that have strong investment expertise and an ability to help supervise fledgling companies.However, first the corporation will need to have a clear idea about what local industries need and what it can offer. It must also recruit a strong management team with access to potential investors.",2

National Federation of Teachers Unions deputy secretary-general Lo Te-shui (?????¡P?¢X?) said.While the Executive Yuan???s reform proposal includes the critical provision, some versions proposed by Democratic Progressive Party legislators do not.A committee review of pension reform for civil servants last week struck out a similar provision from the government-sponsored bill, he added.Eliminating retirees??? access to preferential savings rate accounts offering above market interest rates is a major source of savings under government sponsored reform.However, because such interest is now paid out of the annual budgets of the retirees??? former agencies, the savings will not do much to stave off the pending bankruptcy of the pension funds without a specific mandate increasing proportional government contributions to the funds, he said.???We cannot accept pension reform which devolves into local governments skimming off profits from the cuts,??? he said.Legislation should codify government promises to set up new accounts within the pension funds to ensure that the savings are used to pay the pensions of future retirees, Lo said.He also criticized proposals that would allow the government to adjust pensions ??? without legislative approval ??? when changes to the government???s finances and the national economy require it.Only revisions tied to the consumer price index should be allowed, he said.???[Otherwise] this would probably lead to continual changes,??? Lo said. ???They could tamper with pensions almost at whim.???Union president Chang Hsu-cheng (?????????) called for more flexibility in determining teachers??? retirement age, saying that each teacher???s eligibility should be based on a combination of age and years of service rather than fixed at 60 years of age as the Executive Yuan???s bill stipulates.Absolute ceilings on the pension ???replacement ratios??? relative to teachers??? original salaries would discourage teachers from working longer, Chang said.As pension replacement ratios are calculated based on teachers??? years of service, the fixed ceilings would penalize any teachers who work longer than 35 years, he said.The union also called for Public Employee Insurance to be excluded from the pension ceiling on the grounds that its fund is not expected to go bankrupt anytime soon, unlike the teachers??? general pension fund.",2

Department of Statistics Director-General Beatrice Tsai (?????????) said.The Chinese market accounted for 39.5 percent of Taiwanese exports and 50 percent of all electronics shipments, Tsai said.Electronics underpinned exports with a 31.4 percent contribution last month, led by demand for semiconductors, Tsai said, citing the ministry???s monthly report.Imports of semiconductor equipment rose 80.9 percent last month from a year earlier, indicating that growth momentum for semiconductors remain strong, Tsai said.Imports expanded at a faster pace of 23.5 percent to US$21.53 billion last month from a year earlier, shrinking the trade surplus to US$2.78 billion, a decrease of 41.9 percent from the same period last year, the report showed.The trend could help downsize the nation???s current account surplus, one of the main reasons the US Department of the Treasury keeps Taiwan on its currency monitoring list.Exports to all major trading partners rose and all product categories registered increases, with the exception of textile products due to a seasonal slowdown, the report said.Shipments to ASEAN markets gained faster momentum, rising 14.1 percent year-on-year to US$4.59 billion last month, the report said, as Taiwanese firms increasingly shift production activity to Southeast Asia.The migration has helped spur demand for Taiwanese machinery tools, which might receive a further boost as more manufacturers worldwide replace human labor with automation to improve productivity and cut labor costs, Tsai said.For the first four months of the year, exports expanded 13.6 percent to US$96.42 billion, while imports gained 22.1 percent to US$82.86 billion, the report said.The cumulative trade surplus amounted to US$13.56 billion, a drop of 20.4 percent from the same period last year.Tsai declined to speculate on inventory demand related to Apple Inc???s next-generation mobile devices, saying local firms have not given any clues and the ministry is not in a position to tell.Foreign-exchange volatility and growing competition from Chinese exporters pose downside risks, she said.",2

These are just some examples of Taiwan???s world-class medical achievements, breakthroughs and international contributions.Having been on the receiving end of the international community???s assistance eradicating several communicable diseases, Taiwan, now a nation with advanced medicine and healthcare, is eager to contribute to better global health.However, its eagerness has been rejected by the WHO.The World Health Assembly (WHA), the organization???s highest decisionmaking body, is to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, from May 22 to 31 and yesterday was the last day for online registration to the annual conference. As of press time last night, Taiwan had not been invited.China???s Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun (?????????) yesterday said that so long as Taiwan refuses ???the fundamental condition,??? which he described as the recognition of the ???one China??? principle and the so-called ???1992 consensus,??? there is no basis for Taiwan???s participation in the WHA, or other international organizations for that matter.While China???s bullying is reprehensible, it is just as disappointing to see that the WHO is indifferent to the fact that its autonomy has been usurped by China.The WHO???s objective is ???to build a better, healthier future for people all over the world,??? its Web site says. It says that it ???remains firmly committed to the principles set out in the preamble to the Constitution. Among the principles enshrined in the WHO Constitution include: The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition; The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest co-operation of individuals and States; The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all; and Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of diseases, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.???Against the backdrop of its mission and constitution, is the WHO being hypocritical? Why is an international organization spearheading the global response to epidemic prevention allowing China to hold health concerns of 23 million people in Taiwan to ransom?Those who argue that Taiwan is not a ???state??? and therefore cannot taken part in the WHO should know that statehood is not required for observer status to the WHA and related bodies.By yielding to China, the WHO is jeopardizing the global epidemic prevention network; by discriminating against Taiwan, the WHO is essentially allowing the global healthcare network to be broken, especially since Taiwan is in such close proximity to China, which is notorious for concealing epidemics.",2
2711,World News,"China and the Philippines have joined forces to tackle illegal gambling, part of Beijing???s broader campaign to curb illicit capital outflows and a pledge by Manila to weed out unscrupulous operators from the country???s booming gaming industry.The coordinated crackdown comes amid warming ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) and his Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made illegal gambling the third front in his all-out war on crime, after drugs and corruption.In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities last month cracked a transnational cybergambling operation, shutting four illegal Web sites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China???s Public Security Bureau said.Philippines National Bureau of Investigation cybercrime division chief Martini Cruz told reporters authorities were preparing further raids for this month targeting illegal betting and online fraud originating in the Philippines and targeted at Chinese gamblers.???We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,??? Cruz said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly US$3 billion in overall revenue last year.The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a lives tream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries.While proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world???s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal gray area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Chinese law forbids Chinese from gambling online and at home. The Chinese Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cybergambling is harmful to the country???s economic security, image and stability.However, proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, last month told reporters that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and South Koreans wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year.The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.",2

Day to urge the government to amend the law to improve working conditions and labor rights for migrant workers.Participants rallied in front of the Ministry of Labor at about noontime, calling on the ministry to meet three main demands, before setting off on a parade that ended on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building.The marchers held signs and banners in several languages, with messages such as ???against the government being employer-friendly and using the system to suppress migrant workers,??? ???do not abuse, migrant workers are humans too??? and ???stop sweatshop migrant labor, fight for equal labor rights.???The parade organizer, the Taiwan International Workers??? Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2

The court is to issue its final judgment at the end of this month, at which time New Balance could get damages.New Balance senior global corporate communications manager Amy Dow confirmed the penalty, saying the brand used by all five was called New Boom.Dow said New Balance sued under China???s anti-unfair competition law, because the country???s trademark laws ???currently provide slight loopholes for these brands to exist.??????These actions are significantly more costly than traditional counterfeit enforcement measures, but New Balance believes strongly in the protection of our intellectual property,??? she said.Chinese manufacturers copy everything about a product, but with a slight modification of the brand name.

2754,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2
2782,Front Page,"A legislative review of draft acts to reform the civil servants??? pension plan reached some conclusions yesterday despite brawls and procedural disruptions.Several clauses of the draft acts proposed by the Examination Yuan, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the New Power Party and the People First Party were agreed upon during a meeting of the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee yesterday.There was an extensive debate over the base figure for the calculation of income replacement rate, the minimum pension level, pension contribution rates, parental benefits and the government responsibility for pension payment.The base figure for the calculation of the income replacement rate was determined to be ???two times a civil servant???s basic salary,??? but the committee did not decide on the minimum pension level, saying that it should be decided upon in cross-caucus negotiations.The committee also did not reach consensus on how much the government should help civil servants taking parental leave in paying for their pension premiums to boost the nation???s falling birth rate.A fight erupted between DPP and Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers after DPP Legislator Tuan Yi-kang (????????¡P), a co-convener of the committee, rejected the KMT caucus??? request to have Ministry of Justice officials attend the meeting to provide legal advice on the wording of a clause because Legislative Research Bureau officials were already in attendance.KMT lawmakers stormed the podium, and tempers flared as KMT Legislator Yosi Takun (?????????) scuffled with Tuan as he tried to seize Tuan???s microphone.The meeting was adjourned for nearly an hour until a ministry official arrived.Even before that, KMT lawmakers had tried to delay the discussion, first with a series of procedural maneuvers and then a series of extended speeches that took up most of the morning.The seven motions raised by the KMT caucus included ending the review at 5:30pm to prevent Legislative Yuan staff having to work overtime on Workers???

2836,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

2990,Business,"BMW AG yesterday stuck to a conservative profit forecast as chief executive Harald Krueger seeks patience to push through a transition to self-driving, electric cars.While rival Daimler AG upgraded its target to a ???significant??? gain this year, BMW kept its goal of a ???slight??? increase in earnings, according to a statement from the Munich-based company.BMW is to focus on its higher-end models in the coming years, including a new X7 sport utility vehicle (SUV), as it covers the steep costs of developing the vehicles of the future.???We expect start-up and marketing costs regarding new models to increase over the course of the year,??? BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,??? Natixis Securities analyst Georges Dieng said. ???We think there was room for a more upbeat message.???Research-and-development costs jumped 35 percent to 1.32 billion euros during the quarter. That hurt return on sales, which fell to 9 percent from 9.4 percent a year earlier.Unlike its competitors, BMW has chosen to add electric power trains to existing models rather than design specific electronic vehicles. The company says that approach puts it in a good position to react to changes in demand, as consumers to date have not shown much enthusiasm for ???green??? technology.",2
3001,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

One of them is Janice Chen, an American registered in the US as a foreign agent of Taiwan???s government, specifically the Democratic Progressive Party.Lin said he and Chen often discussed news articles she e-mailed him about military affairs.He admitted that he shared classified information about the navy???s Pacific Fleet with her.He also divulged secrets to a woman named ???Katherine Wu,??? whom he believed worked as a contractor for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She was actually an undercover FBI agent.???I was trying to let her know that the military profession in the United States is an honorable and noble one,??? Lin told US Navy Commander Robert Monahan, the military judge.He said the military is less prestigious in Taiwan.Lin also had friends with other connections, including a woman living in China whom he met online, and a Chinese massage therapist who moved to Hawaii.Lin said he gave the massage therapist a ???large sum of money??? at one point, although he did not say why.He also admitted to lying to superiors about flying to Taiwan and planning to visit China.However, Lin said he did it only to avoid the bureaucracy that a US military official must endure when traveling to a foreign nation.???Sir, I was arrogant,??? he told Monahan.A navy news release about Lin???s attendance at his naturalization ceremony in Hawaii in December 2008 said he was 14 when he and his family left Taiwan.???I always dreamed about coming to America, the ???promised land,??????

Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations. It also provides an opportunity for the nation to develop talented people that have strong investment expertise and an ability to help supervise fledgling companies.However, first the corporation will need to have a clear idea about what local industries need and what it can offer. It must also recruit a strong management team with access to potential investors.",2

National Federation of Teachers Unions deputy secretary-general Lo Te-shui (?????¡P?¢X?) said.While the Executive Yuan???s reform proposal includes the critical provision, some versions proposed by Democratic Progressive Party legislators do not.A committee review of pension reform for civil servants last week struck out a similar provision from the government-sponsored bill, he added.Eliminating retirees??? access to preferential savings rate accounts offering above market interest rates is a major source of savings under government sponsored reform.However, because such interest is now paid out of the annual budgets of the retirees??? former agencies, the savings will not do much to stave off the pending bankruptcy of the pension funds without a specific mandate increasing proportional government contributions to the funds, he said.???We cannot accept pension reform which devolves into local governments skimming off profits from the cuts,??? he said.Legislation should codify government promises to set up new accounts within the pension funds to ensure that the savings are used to pay the pensions of future retirees, Lo said.He also criticized proposals that would allow the government to adjust pensions ??? without legislative approval ??? when changes to the government???s finances and the national economy require it.Only revisions tied to the consumer price index should be allowed, he said.???[Otherwise] this would probably lead to continual changes,??? Lo said. ???They could tamper with pensions almost at whim.???Union president Chang Hsu-cheng (?????????) called for more flexibility in determining teachers??? retirement age, saying that each teacher???s eligibility should be based on a combination of age and years of service rather than fixed at 60 years of age as the Executive Yuan???s bill stipulates.Absolute ceilings on the pension ???replacement ratios??? relative to teachers??? original salaries would discourage teachers from working longer, Chang said.As pension replacement ratios are calculated based on teachers??? years of service, the fixed ceilings would penalize any teachers who work longer than 35 years, he said.The union also called for Public Employee Insurance to be excluded from the pension ceiling on the grounds that its fund is not expected to go bankrupt anytime soon, unlike the teachers??? general pension fund.",2

Why is an international organization spearheading the global response to epidemic prevention allowing China to hold health concerns of 23 million people in Taiwan to ransom?Those who argue that Taiwan is not a ???state??? and therefore cannot taken part in the WHO should know that statehood is not required for observer status to the WHA and related bodies.By yielding to China, the WHO is jeopardizing the global epidemic prevention network; by discriminating against Taiwan, the WHO is essentially allowing the global healthcare network to be broken, especially since Taiwan is in such close proximity to China, which is notorious for concealing epidemics.",2
3257,World News,"China and the Philippines have joined forces to tackle illegal gambling, part of Beijing???s broader campaign to curb illicit capital outflows and a pledge by Manila to weed out unscrupulous operators from the country???s booming gaming industry.The coordinated crackdown comes amid warming ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) and his Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made illegal gambling the third front in his all-out war on crime, after drugs and corruption.In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities last month cracked a transnational cybergambling operation, shutting four illegal Web sites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China???s Public Security Bureau said.Philippines National Bureau of Investigation cybercrime division chief Martini Cruz told reporters authorities were preparing further raids for this month targeting illegal betting and online fraud originating in the Philippines and targeted at Chinese gamblers.???We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,??? Cruz said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly US$3 billion in overall revenue last year.The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a lives tream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries.While proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world???s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal gray area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Chinese law forbids Chinese from gambling online and at home. The Chinese Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cybergambling is harmful to the country???s economic security, image and stability.However, proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, last month told reporters that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and South Koreans wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year.The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.",2

3277,Taiwan News,"The navy is still monitoring the waters off Kaohsiung to prevent Chinese spy vessels from picking up sensitive components from the Hsiung Feng III missile that was accidentally fired on July 1 last year, an officer said on Monday.The anti-ship missile was accidentally fired by a Republic of China Navy Chinchiang-class corvette during a training exercise and struck a fishing trawler, killing one person and injuring three.After intensive efforts to find the missile failed to produce any trace of the device, the navy concluded that it might have been totally destroyed after detonating when it hit the waters, said the officer, who declined to be named.Although disintegration and immersion in salt water would likely make any debris worthless for intelligence purposes, the navy has been monitoring the area to prevent possible recovery of pieces by Chinese vessels and will continue to do so, the officer said.The performance and design of the Hsiung Feng III are classified and the navy is determined to minimize any risk lest such information be compromised, the officer said.To prevent the Chinese from finding the wreckage, the navy fully intends to surveil the impact zone on a long-term basis and the operation patterns of all ships in the area are scrutinized for any abnormality, the officer said.On the day of the mishap, the navy sent out six ships and a Sikorsky S-70C helicopter to look for the missile and to secure the air-sea perimeter, the officer said.The navy called on technicians from the National Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology and calculated the flight path of the missile, the officer said.The search area was broadened by taking tide and current data into consideration.The salvage operation ??? which did not find any parts from the missile ??? took 62 days, covered 118 square nautical miles (405km2) of water and involved 10 missions by mine hunters, five missions by oceanic survey ship Takuan and 14 missions by a landing craft utility vessel, the officer said.",2

Edward Jones & Co analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ???The good thing is, Coach has been through this before and shown they can be successful.???Heavy discounting by wholesale customers has hurt the cachet of brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, which sell mostly through their own stores and online.To fight back, they are trying to move fewer products through discounters such as TJ Maxx and department stores, which have been slashing prices on luxury handbags to cope with slower mall traffic.Coach on Monday said it would buy Kate Spade as part of its strategy to build a multi-brand lifestyle company from New York, where both companies are based. Known for its whimsical handbag designs, Kate Spade has been successful at luring millennials, who make up 60 percent of its customers.Kate Spade had become ???too dependent on the overly promotional channels of online flash sales and wholesale disposition,??? Coach chief executive officer Victor Luis said.To boost its own margins, Coach has been adding more handbags to its luxury 1941 line and stepping up store services to draw shoppers who are willing to pay top dollar.Coach???s comparable-store sales in North America rose 3 percent in the first quarter, the fourth consecutive gain and above the 1.4 percent increase predicted by analysts.Gross margins expanded 1.9 percentage points year-on-year to 70.9 percent.Coach has also said sales of items priced at more than US$400 now make up 55 percent of handbag sales in North America, an increase from 40 percent posted during the same period last year. The results, delivered last week, sent the stock surging 11 percent, its biggest daily gain in more than six years.Coach, Kate Spade and their rival Michael Kors Holdings Ltd still have work to do to whittle down the excess inventory at retailers.

3332,Front Page,"Hundreds of migrant workers and members of labor rights groups yesterday took to the streets of Taipei on the eve of Workers??? Day to urge the government to amend the law to improve working conditions and labor rights for migrant workers.Participants rallied in front of the Ministry of Labor at about noontime, calling on the ministry to meet three main demands, before setting off on a parade that ended on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building.The marchers held signs and banners in several languages, with messages such as ???against the government being employer-friendly and using the system to suppress migrant workers,??? ???do not abuse, migrant workers are humans too??? and ???stop sweatshop migrant labor, fight for equal labor rights.???The parade organizer, the Taiwan International Workers??? Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2

3361,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2

3443,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,??? Natixis Securities analyst Georges Dieng said. ???We think there was room for a more upbeat message.???Research-and-development costs jumped 35 percent to 1.32 billion euros during the quarter. That hurt return on sales, which fell to 9 percent from 9.4 percent a year earlier.Unlike its competitors, BMW has chosen to add electric power trains to existing models rather than design specific electronic vehicles.

3608,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

One of them is Janice Chen, an American registered in the US as a foreign agent of Taiwan???s government, specifically the Democratic Progressive Party.Lin said he and Chen often discussed news articles she e-mailed him about military affairs.He admitted that he shared classified information about the navy???s Pacific Fleet with her.He also divulged secrets to a woman named ???Katherine Wu,??? whom he believed worked as a contractor for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She was actually an undercover FBI agent.???I was trying to let her know that the military profession in the United States is an honorable and noble one,???

Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations. It also provides an opportunity for the nation to develop talented people that have strong investment expertise and an ability to help supervise fledgling companies.However, first the corporation will need to have a clear idea about what local industries need and what it can offer. It must also recruit a strong management team with access to potential investors.",2

National Federation of Teachers Unions deputy secretary-general Lo Te-shui (?????¡P?¢X?) said.While the Executive Yuan???s reform proposal includes the critical provision, some versions proposed by Democratic Progressive Party legislators do not.A committee review of pension reform for civil servants last week struck out a similar provision from the government-sponsored bill, he added.Eliminating retirees??? access to preferential savings rate accounts offering above market interest rates is a major source of savings under government sponsored reform.However, because such interest is now paid out of the annual budgets of the retirees??? former agencies, the savings will not do much to stave off the pending bankruptcy of the pension funds without a specific mandate increasing proportional government contributions to the funds, he said.???We cannot accept pension reform which devolves into local governments skimming off profits from the cuts,??? he said.Legislation should codify government promises to set up new accounts within the pension funds to ensure that the savings are used to pay the pensions of future retirees, Lo said.He also criticized proposals that would allow the government to adjust pensions ??? without legislative approval ??? when changes to the government???s finances and the national economy require it.Only revisions tied to the consumer price index should be allowed, he said.???[Otherwise] this would probably lead to continual changes,??? Lo said. ???They could tamper with pensions almost at whim.???Union president Chang Hsu-cheng (?????????) called for more flexibility in determining teachers??? retirement age, saying that each teacher???s eligibility should be based on a combination of age and years of service rather than fixed at 60 years of age as the Executive Yuan???s bill stipulates.Absolute ceilings on the pension ???replacement ratios??? relative to teachers??? original salaries would discourage teachers from working longer, Chang said.As pension replacement ratios are calculated based on teachers??? years of service, the fixed ceilings would penalize any teachers who work longer than 35 years, he said.The union also called for Public Employee Insurance to be excluded from the pension ceiling on the grounds that its fund is not expected to go bankrupt anytime soon, unlike the teachers??? general pension fund.",2

3831,Business,"Exports rose 9.4 percent to US$24.32 billion last month from a year earlier, with growth decelerating from March???s 13.2 percent, as demand for electronics used in smartphones and TVs slowed in China, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday.Despite inventory adjustments, outbound shipments are expected to continue expanding at a high single-digit percentage this month and beyond, amid a stable economic recovery worldwide, the ministry said.???Demand for smartphones and large-sized TVs turned out weaker than expected over the Labor Day sales season, prompting firms to adjust inventory,??? Department of Statistics Director-General Beatrice Tsai (?????????) said.The Chinese market accounted for 39.5 percent of Taiwanese exports and 50 percent of all electronics shipments, Tsai said.Electronics underpinned exports with a 31.4 percent contribution last month, led by demand for semiconductors, Tsai said, citing the ministry???s monthly report.Imports of semiconductor equipment rose 80.9 percent last month from a year earlier, indicating that growth momentum for semiconductors remain strong, Tsai said.Imports expanded at a faster pace of 23.5 percent to US$21.53 billion last month from a year earlier, shrinking the trade surplus to US$2.78 billion, a decrease of 41.9 percent from the same period last year, the report showed.The trend could help downsize the nation???s current account surplus, one of the main reasons the US Department of the Treasury keeps Taiwan on its currency monitoring list.Exports to all major trading partners rose and all product categories registered increases, with the exception of textile products due to a seasonal slowdown, the report said.Shipments to ASEAN markets gained faster momentum, rising 14.1 percent year-on-year to US$4.59 billion last month, the report said, as Taiwanese firms increasingly shift production activity to Southeast Asia.The migration has helped spur demand for Taiwanese machinery tools, which might receive a further boost as more manufacturers worldwide replace human labor with automation to improve productivity and cut labor costs, Tsai said.For the first four months of the year, exports expanded 13.6 percent to US$96.42 billion, while imports gained 22.1 percent to US$82.86 billion, the report said.The cumulative trade surplus amounted to US$13.56 billion, a drop of 20.4 percent from the same period last year.Tsai declined to speculate on inventory demand related to Apple Inc???s next-generation mobile devices, saying local firms have not given any clues and the ministry is not in a position to tell.Foreign-exchange volatility and growing competition from Chinese exporters pose downside risks, she said.",2

3864,World News,"China and the Philippines have joined forces to tackle illegal gambling, part of Beijing???s broader campaign to curb illicit capital outflows and a pledge by Manila to weed out unscrupulous operators from the country???s booming gaming industry.The coordinated crackdown comes amid warming ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) and his Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made illegal gambling the third front in his all-out war on crime, after drugs and corruption.In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities last month cracked a transnational cybergambling operation, shutting four illegal Web sites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China???s Public Security Bureau said.Philippines National Bureau of Investigation cybercrime division chief Martini Cruz told reporters authorities were preparing further raids for this month targeting illegal betting and online fraud originating in the Philippines and targeted at Chinese gamblers.???We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,??? Cruz said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly US$3 billion in overall revenue last year.The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a lives tream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries.While proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world???s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal gray area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Chinese law forbids Chinese from gambling online and at home. The Chinese Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cybergambling is harmful to the country???s economic security, image and stability.However, proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, last month told reporters that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and South Koreans wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year.The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.",2

KMT caucus convener Sufin Siluko (???????¢G?) asked how a four-year project turned into an eight-year one in such a short time and demanded that the plan be sent back to the Executive Yuan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus accused the KMT of inconsistency in opposing the plan.Even as the KMT caucus was trying to boycott the infrastructure plan, New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu (??¡Ó??????) was meeting with local lawmakers to seek their support in securing funds from the project for infrastructure in his municipality, DPP Legislator Su Chiao-hui (????¡P¡±??¡±) said.While boycotting the plan, the KMT did not specifically oppose any of the infrastructure projects listed in it, DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi (???????¡Â?) said.???The KMT cannot just say it does not want the plan.

3884,Taiwan News,"The navy is still monitoring the waters off Kaohsiung to prevent Chinese spy vessels from picking up sensitive components from the Hsiung Feng III missile that was accidentally fired on July 1 last year, an officer said on Monday.The anti-ship missile was accidentally fired by a Republic of China Navy Chinchiang-class corvette during a training exercise and struck a fishing trawler, killing one person and injuring three.After intensive efforts to find the missile failed to produce any trace of the device, the navy concluded that it might have been totally destroyed after detonating when it hit the waters, said the officer, who declined to be named.Although disintegration and immersion in salt water would likely make any debris worthless for intelligence purposes, the navy has been monitoring the area to prevent possible recovery of pieces by Chinese vessels and will continue to do so, the officer said.The performance and design of the Hsiung Feng III are classified and the navy is determined to minimize any risk lest such information be compromised, the officer said.To prevent the Chinese from finding the wreckage, the navy fully intends to surveil the impact zone on a long-term basis and the operation patterns of all ships in the area are scrutinized for any abnormality, the officer said.On the day of the mishap, the navy sent out six ships and a Sikorsky S-70C helicopter to look for the missile and to secure the air-sea perimeter, the officer said.The navy called on technicians from the National Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology and calculated the flight path of the missile, the officer said.The search area was broadened by taking tide and current data into consideration.The salvage operation ??? which did not find any parts from the missile ??? took 62 days, covered 118 square nautical miles (405km2) of water and involved 10 missions by mine hunters, five missions by oceanic survey ship Takuan and 14 missions by a landing craft utility vessel, the officer said.",2

Edward Jones & Co analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ???The good thing is, Coach has been through this before and shown they can be successful.???Heavy discounting by wholesale customers has hurt the cachet of brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, which sell mostly through their own stores and online.To fight back, they are trying to move fewer products through discounters such as TJ Maxx and department stores, which have been slashing prices on luxury handbags to cope with slower mall traffic.Coach on Monday said it would buy Kate Spade as part of its strategy to build a multi-brand lifestyle company from New York, where both companies are based. Known for its whimsical handbag designs, Kate Spade has been successful at luring millennials, who make up 60 percent of its customers.Kate Spade had become ???too dependent on the overly promotional channels of online flash sales and wholesale disposition,???

4031,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature.

4113,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,??? DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (?????????) said.???The founding philosophy of the WHA is health for all, but the reality is health for all except for Taiwanese,??? Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation. Is the KMT speaking for China or Taiwan???? Wang said.There should be no preconditions for WHA membership, and using membership as political leverage runs counter to the principles on which the WHO is founded, Lo said.Taiwan is an important contributor to global immunization and disaster relief, and the nation???s health insurance system ensures quality and affordable healthcare to all citizens, which has been closely studied by governments and international medical bodies, DPP Legislator and TMA president Chiu Tai-yuan (??¡Ó??¢X???) said.Taiwan is ranked first in Asia and sixth in the world in terms of palliative care, and this global leader in healthcare and medicine should not be excluded from the WHA for political reasons, Chiu said.China has also attempted to pressure the World Medical Association (WMA) to rename the TMA the ???Taiwan China Medical Association,??? TMA secretary-general Wang Bi-sheng (?????????) said.The Chinese association issued a written request during the WMA general assembly in Zambia last month for the name change, but the request was rejected because WMA members understood that the TMA is a non-political body and the issue should not be treated politically, Wang said.???China had made informal proposals to change the name of the TMA, but it was the first time it issued a written request. It is expected that China will make another formal request at the general assembly in October,??? Wang said.",2

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

4267,Business,"BMW AG yesterday stuck to a conservative profit forecast as chief executive Harald Krueger seeks patience to push through a transition to self-driving, electric cars.While rival Daimler AG upgraded its target to a ???significant??? gain this year, BMW kept its goal of a ???slight??? increase in earnings, according to a statement from the Munich-based company.BMW is to focus on its higher-end models in the coming years, including a new X7 sport utility vehicle (SUV), as it covers the steep costs of developing the vehicles of the future.???We expect start-up and marketing costs regarding new models to increase over the course of the year,??? BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,??? Natixis Securities analyst Georges Dieng said. ???We think there was room for a more upbeat message.???Research-and-development costs jumped 35 percent to 1.32 billion euros during the quarter. That hurt return on sales, which fell to 9 percent from 9.4 percent a year earlier.Unlike its competitors, BMW has chosen to add electric power trains to existing models rather than design specific electronic vehicles.

4278,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations. It also provides an opportunity for the nation to develop talented people that have strong investment expertise and an ability to help supervise fledgling companies.However, first the corporation will need to have a clear idea about what local industries need and what it can offer. It must also recruit a strong management team with access to potential investors.",2

However this year is the first time that the ITRI has participated in the competition and been recognized with an award.Developed in collaboration with Stanford University since 2013, the URABat has achieved three breakthroughs, including finding the perfect combination of aluminum and graphite for the battery cell and making a battery cell that can be mass-produced for various needs and to various specifications.A 48V/1Ah aluminum battery installed in an electric bicycle for road tests acheived a full charge within 6 minutes, 20 times faster than conventional lead-acid batteries. The battery is made of highly stable graphite and aluminum materials and does not combust when damaged.The development of URABat was published in the journal Nature in 2015, and in 2016 it won the R&D; 100 Awards.???URABat is expected to offer a new power storage alternative that will have a huge impact on the world,??? said the head of the ITRI delegation, Dr. Yang Chang-chung, Deputy Division Director of ITRI???s Green Energy and Environment Research Labs.???There has never been a significant development in battery technology quite like the ITRI,??? commented Frank Bonafilia, executive director of the Edison Awards.TODAY???S WORDS ?????¢D??????1. rechargeable adj.??¡Â?????????

4488,Taiwan News,"Money saved from getting rid of preferential savings rate accounts for retired public employees should be plowed back into the nation???s pension funds, a teachers??? union said yesterday as the Legislative Yuan began review of bills on  reforming teachers??? pension.???There is only one criterion as we look at reform ??? whether or not any money that is saved is entirely plowed into the pensions funds,??? National Federation of Teachers Unions deputy secretary-general Lo Te-shui (?????¡P?¢X?) said.While the Executive Yuan???s reform proposal includes the critical provision, some versions proposed by Democratic Progressive Party legislators do not.A committee review of pension reform for civil servants last week struck out a similar provision from the government-sponsored bill, he added.Eliminating retirees??? access to preferential savings rate accounts offering above market interest rates is a major source of savings under government sponsored reform.However, because such interest is now paid out of the annual budgets of the retirees??? former agencies, the savings will not do much to stave off the pending bankruptcy of the pension funds without a specific mandate increasing proportional government contributions to the funds, he said.???We cannot accept pension reform which devolves into local governments skimming off profits from the cuts,??? he said.Legislation should codify government promises to set up new accounts within the pension funds to ensure that the savings are used to pay the pensions of future retirees, Lo said.He also criticized proposals that would allow the government to adjust pensions ??? without legislative approval ??? when changes to the government???s finances and the national economy require it.Only revisions tied to the consumer price index should be allowed, he said.???[Otherwise] this would probably lead to continual changes,??? Lo said. ???They could tamper with pensions almost at whim.???Union president Chang Hsu-cheng (?????????) called for more flexibility in determining teachers??? retirement age, saying that each teacher???s eligibility should be based on a combination of age and years of service rather than fixed at 60 years of age as the Executive Yuan???s bill stipulates.Absolute ceilings on the pension ???replacement ratios??? relative to teachers??? original salaries would discourage teachers from working longer, Chang said.As pension replacement ratios are calculated based on teachers??? years of service, the fixed ceilings would penalize any teachers who work longer than 35 years, he said.The union also called for Public Employee Insurance to be excluded from the pension ceiling on the grounds that its fund is not expected to go bankrupt anytime soon, unlike the teachers??? general pension fund.",2
4496,Taiwan News,"Environmentalists attending a public forum held by the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) yesterday criticized the council for what they said was its lax supervision of Taiwan Power Co (Taipower) regarding the company???s management of the Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei City???s Shihmen District (??????).Taipower on April 29 initiated a coastdown of the plant???s No. 2 reactor, allowing the power level to decrease from 100 to 75 percent, without informing the council.This has caused a scheduled overhaul of the reactor to be postponed for two weeks to the middle of next month, AEC Department of Nuclear Regulation division head Tsao Sung-nan (???????¢D?) said.The council last week set up an ad-hoc committee to investigate the incident.Yesterday???s forum was aimed at collecting opinions from non-governmental experts.AEC Department of Nuclear Regulation head Chang Shin (?????¢G) quoted Taipower as saying that the coastdown was done for ???distribution of electricity??? resons and not out of security concerns.???We immediately sent an official to examine the situation that day,??? Chang said, adding that Taipower has submitted an evaluation report about the incident, which was posted on the council???s Web site.However, many environmentalists at the forum doubted whether Taipower told the truth.The coastdown might implicate a security crisis that can be described as ???hitting the brake and the accelerator at the same time,??? said He Li-wei (?????????), a former researcher at the AEC Institute of Nuclear Energy Research.???[The coastdown] has extended [the reactor???s] operation for another 15 days, but did not generate any more electricity,???

4501,Business,"Exports rose 9.4 percent to US$24.32 billion last month from a year earlier, with growth decelerating from March???s 13.2 percent, as demand for electronics used in smartphones and TVs slowed in China, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday.Despite inventory adjustments, outbound shipments are expected to continue expanding at a high single-digit percentage this month and beyond, amid a stable economic recovery worldwide, the ministry said.???Demand for smartphones and large-sized TVs turned out weaker than expected over the Labor Day sales season, prompting firms to adjust inventory,??? Department of Statistics Director-General Beatrice Tsai (?????????) said.The Chinese market accounted for 39.5 percent of Taiwanese exports and 50 percent of all electronics shipments, Tsai said.Electronics underpinned exports with a 31.4 percent contribution last month, led by demand for semiconductors, Tsai said, citing the ministry???s monthly report.Imports of semiconductor equipment rose 80.9 percent last month from a year earlier, indicating that growth momentum for semiconductors remain strong, Tsai said.Imports expanded at a faster pace of 23.5 percent to US$21.53 billion last month from a year earlier, shrinking the trade surplus to US$2.78 billion, a decrease of 41.9 percent from the same period last year, the report showed.The trend could help downsize the nation???s current account surplus, one of the main reasons the US Department of the Treasury keeps Taiwan on its currency monitoring list.Exports to all major trading partners rose and all product categories registered increases, with the exception of textile products due to a seasonal slowdown, the report said.Shipments to ASEAN markets gained faster momentum, rising 14.1 percent year-on-year to US$4.59 billion last month, the report said, as Taiwanese firms increasingly shift production activity to Southeast Asia.The migration has helped spur demand for Taiwanese machinery tools, which might receive a further boost as more manufacturers worldwide replace human labor with automation to improve productivity and cut labor costs, Tsai said.For the first four months of the year, exports expanded 13.6 percent to US$96.42 billion, while imports gained 22.1 percent to US$82.86 billion, the report said.The cumulative trade surplus amounted to US$13.56 billion, a drop of 20.4 percent from the same period last year.Tsai declined to speculate on inventory demand related to Apple Inc???s next-generation mobile devices, saying local firms have not given any clues and the ministry is not in a position to tell.Foreign-exchange volatility and growing competition from Chinese exporters pose downside risks, she said.",2

These are just some examples of Taiwan???s world-class medical achievements, breakthroughs and international contributions.Having been on the receiving end of the international community???s assistance eradicating several communicable diseases, Taiwan, now a nation with advanced medicine and healthcare, is eager to contribute to better global health.However, its eagerness has been rejected by the WHO.The World Health Assembly (WHA), the organization???s highest decisionmaking body, is to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, from May 22 to 31 and yesterday was the last day for online registration to the annual conference. As of press time last night, Taiwan had not been invited.China???s Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun (?????????) yesterday said that so long as Taiwan refuses ???the fundamental condition,??? which he described as the recognition of the ???one China??? principle and the so-called ???1992 consensus,??? there is no basis for Taiwan???s participation in the WHA, or other international organizations for that matter.While China???s bullying is reprehensible, it is just as disappointing to see that the WHO is indifferent to the fact that its autonomy has been usurped by China.The WHO???s objective is ???to build a better, healthier future for people all over the world,??? its Web site says. It says that it ???remains firmly committed to the principles set out in the preamble to the Constitution. Among the principles enshrined in the WHO Constitution include: The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition; The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest co-operation of individuals and States; The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all; and Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of diseases, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.???Against the backdrop of its mission and constitution, is the WHO being hypocritical? Why is an international organization spearheading the global response to epidemic prevention allowing China to hold health concerns of 23 million people in Taiwan to ransom?Those who argue that Taiwan is not a ???state??? and therefore cannot taken part in the WHO should know that statehood is not required for observer status to the WHA and related bodies.By yielding to China, the WHO is jeopardizing the global epidemic prevention network; by discriminating against Taiwan, the WHO is essentially allowing the global healthcare network to be broken, especially since Taiwan is in such close proximity to China, which is notorious for concealing epidemics.",2
4534,World News,"China and the Philippines have joined forces to tackle illegal gambling, part of Beijing???s broader campaign to curb illicit capital outflows and a pledge by Manila to weed out unscrupulous operators from the country???s booming gaming industry.The coordinated crackdown comes amid warming ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) and his Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made illegal gambling the third front in his all-out war on crime, after drugs and corruption.In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities last month cracked a transnational cybergambling operation, shutting four illegal Web sites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China???s Public Security Bureau said.Philippines National Bureau of Investigation cybercrime division chief Martini Cruz told reporters authorities were preparing further raids for this month targeting illegal betting and online fraud originating in the Philippines and targeted at Chinese gamblers.???We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,??? Cruz said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly US$3 billion in overall revenue last year.The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a lives tream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries.While proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world???s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal gray area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Chinese law forbids Chinese from gambling online and at home. The Chinese Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cybergambling is harmful to the country???s economic security, image and stability.However, proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, last month told reporters that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and South Koreans wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year.The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.",2

KMT caucus convener Sufin Siluko (???????¢G?) asked how a four-year project turned into an eight-year one in such a short time and demanded that the plan be sent back to the Executive Yuan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus accused the KMT of inconsistency in opposing the plan.Even as the KMT caucus was trying to boycott the infrastructure plan, New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu (??¡Ó??????) was meeting with local lawmakers to seek their support in securing funds from the project for infrastructure in his municipality, DPP Legislator Su Chiao-hui (????¡P¡±??¡±) said.While boycotting the plan, the KMT did not specifically oppose any of the infrastructure projects listed in it, DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi (???????¡Â?) said.???The KMT cannot just say it does not want the plan.

4554,Taiwan News,"The navy is still monitoring the waters off Kaohsiung to prevent Chinese spy vessels from picking up sensitive components from the Hsiung Feng III missile that was accidentally fired on July 1 last year, an officer said on Monday.The anti-ship missile was accidentally fired by a Republic of China Navy Chinchiang-class corvette during a training exercise and struck a fishing trawler, killing one person and injuring three.After intensive efforts to find the missile failed to produce any trace of the device, the navy concluded that it might have been totally destroyed after detonating when it hit the waters, said the officer, who declined to be named.Although disintegration and immersion in salt water would likely make any debris worthless for intelligence purposes, the navy has been monitoring the area to prevent possible recovery of pieces by Chinese vessels and will continue to do so, the officer said.The performance and design of the Hsiung Feng III are classified and the navy is determined to minimize any risk lest such information be compromised, the officer said.To prevent the Chinese from finding the wreckage, the navy fully intends to surveil the impact zone on a long-term basis and the operation patterns of all ships in the area are scrutinized for any abnormality, the officer said.On the day of the mishap, the navy sent out six ships and a Sikorsky S-70C helicopter to look for the missile and to secure the air-sea perimeter, the officer said.The navy called on technicians from the National Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology and calculated the flight path of the missile, the officer said.The search area was broadened by taking tide and current data into consideration.The salvage operation ??? which did not find any parts from the missile ??? took 62 days, covered 118 square nautical miles (405km2) of water and involved 10 missions by mine hunters, five missions by oceanic survey ship Takuan and 14 missions by a landing craft utility vessel, the officer said.",2

Edward Jones & Co analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ???The good thing is, Coach has been through this before and shown they can be successful.???Heavy discounting by wholesale customers has hurt the cachet of brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, which sell mostly through their own stores and online.To fight back, they are trying to move fewer products through discounters such as TJ Maxx and department stores, which have been slashing prices on luxury handbags to cope with slower mall traffic.Coach on Monday said it would buy Kate Spade as part of its strategy to build a multi-brand lifestyle company from New York, where both companies are based. Known for its whimsical handbag designs, Kate Spade has been successful at luring millennials, who make up 60 percent of its customers.Kate Spade had become ???too dependent on the overly promotional channels of online flash sales and wholesale disposition,??? Coach chief executive officer Victor Luis said.To boost its own margins, Coach has been adding more handbags to its luxury 1941 line and stepping up store services to draw shoppers who are willing to pay top dollar.Coach???s comparable-store sales in North America rose 3 percent in the first quarter, the fourth consecutive gain and above the 1.4 percent increase predicted by analysts.Gross margins expanded 1.9 percentage points year-on-year to 70.9 percent.Coach has also said sales of items priced at more than US$400 now make up 55 percent of handbag sales in North America, an increase from 40 percent posted during the same period last year. The results, delivered last week, sent the stock surging 11 percent, its biggest daily gain in more than six years.Coach, Kate Spade and their rival Michael Kors Holdings Ltd still have work to do to whittle down the excess inventory at retailers.

Office, the Taiwan High Court in September last year upheld a lower court???s guilty verdict against Ho, handing down a suspended sentence of three months for death through negligence, which could be reduced to a NT$90,000 fine.Ho has insisted that he acted properly to defend his pregnant wife when Chang broke into their residence in October 2014.Ho kept Chang in a choke hold until the police arrived 10 minutes after being called.By the time the police arrived, Chang had lost consciousness, and he later died at a local hospital.Reviewing the evidence, the judges said Chang suffered from a cardiovascular condition and could not endure a long deprivation from oxygen, and that Ho???s tight choke hold had caused internal bleeding in the neck region.They concluded that Ho???s actions had directly led to Chang???s death.???This is a very unfair decision and I cannot accept it. I will definitely appeal it, because it is an injustice,??? Ho told reporters.???The burglar broke into my house first. How could I know whether he was carrying weapons or had brought accomplices????

Association (TIWA), said it has been 25 years since migrant workers were first allowed in Taiwan, but government regulations have worsened and had thrown the employer-employee relationship off balance for the sake of easier management.The protesters??? three main demands were: abolish the private employment brokerage system and enforce direct recruitment between nation; allow migrant workers to freely switch employers; and fight against the market-driven long-term care service system while protecting household workers??? rights through the Labor Standards Act (???????????????).???We never asked a local worker to pay a brokerage fee of NT$80,000 to NT$150,000 to get a job, so why do migrant workers have to endure such exploitation???? the Migrants Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) said, urging the government to act as an intermediary to prevent exploitation of migrants.???It is ridiculous that migrant workers can only resign if their employer agrees to it,??? the TIWA said, urging lawmakers to amend Article 53 of the Employment Services Act (?¢X¡Ó?¢D??????????).Taiwan???s long-term care service system should be public, because allowing it to become privately run or market-driven will worsen labor conditions for local and migrant caregivers or household workers alike, TIWA said, adding that more than half of migrant household workers work year round, with no holidays.A Vietnamese woman who has worked as a household caregiver for eight years said she had to work long hours and be on stand-by nearly every day, without holidays.She also said that she had to pay a large proportion of her salary to a manpower agency every month.When the marchers reached Ketagelan Boulevard, they tossed paper planes carrying their ???blood-sweat demands??? toward the Presidential Office to symbolize their sending their voices to the president.The Ministry of Labor issued a news release in the afternoon saying that it would ???enhance current direct employment measures, re-examine the eligibility requirements for transferring between employers and try to implement respite care service for employers of migrant household workers to improve and protect their labor rights.???The ministry said it has established a direct employment joint services center for employers to recruit migrant workers without having to use brokers and created an accreditation mechanism to evaluate recruitment agencies.The success rate of transferring workers between employers is about 93.3 percent as of February, the mininstry said.",2

The court is to issue its final judgment at the end of this month, at which time New Balance could get damages.New Balance senior global corporate communications manager Amy Dow confirmed the penalty, saying the brand used by all five was called New Boom.Dow said New Balance sued under China???s anti-unfair competition law, because the country???s trademark laws ???currently provide slight loopholes for these brands to exist.??????These actions are significantly more costly than traditional counterfeit enforcement measures, but New Balance believes strongly in the protection of our intellectual property,??? she said.Chinese manufacturers copy everything about a product, but with a slight modification of the brand name.

4768,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2

Day; postponing the review until the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan report to the legislature on pension issues; that the government announce long-term reform plans to keep the pension funds afloat for at least 30 years; and for a constitutional interpretation to be sought on conflicting reform proposals.The DPP majority on the committee was able to reject the KMT motions.Saying that it did not oppose the reform, the KMT said the principle of legitimate expectation needed to be recognized.Some of the proposals might breach legitimate expectations, as civil servants ???decided to take government jobs under the presumption that they would be entitled to retirement benefits guaranteed by the existing system,???

4850,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,???

Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation.

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed.

These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe.

Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations. It also provides an opportunity for the nation to develop talented people that have strong investment expertise and an ability to help supervise fledgling companies.However, first the corporation will need to have a clear idea about what local industries need and what it can offer. It must also recruit a strong management team with access to potential investors.",2

National Federation of Teachers Unions deputy secretary-general Lo Te-shui (?????¡P?¢X?) said.While the Executive Yuan???s reform proposal includes the critical provision, some versions proposed by Democratic Progressive Party legislators do not.A committee review of pension reform for civil servants last week struck out a similar provision from the government-sponsored bill, he added.Eliminating retirees??? access to preferential savings rate accounts offering above market interest rates is a major source of savings under government sponsored reform.However, because such interest is now paid out of the annual budgets of the retirees??? former agencies, the savings will not do much to stave off the pending bankruptcy of the pension funds without a specific mandate increasing proportional government contributions to the funds, he said.???We cannot accept pension reform which devolves into local governments skimming off profits from the cuts,??? he said.Legislation should codify government promises to set up new accounts within the pension funds to ensure that the savings are used to pay the pensions of future retirees, Lo said.He also criticized proposals that would allow the government to adjust pensions ??? without legislative approval ??? when changes to the government???s finances and the national economy require it.Only revisions tied to the consumer price index should be allowed, he said.???[Otherwise] this would probably lead to continual changes,??? Lo said. ???They could tamper with pensions almost at whim.???Union president Chang Hsu-cheng (?????????) called for more flexibility in determining teachers??? retirement age, saying that each teacher???s eligibility should be based on a combination of age and years of service rather than fixed at 60 years of age as the Executive Yuan???s bill stipulates.Absolute ceilings on the pension ???replacement ratios??? relative to teachers??? original salaries would discourage teachers from working longer, Chang said.As pension replacement ratios are calculated based on teachers??? years of service, the fixed ceilings would penalize any teachers who work longer than 35 years, he said.The union also called for Public Employee Insurance to be excluded from the pension ceiling on the grounds that its fund is not expected to go bankrupt anytime soon, unlike the teachers??? general pension fund.",2

They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,??? Cruz said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly US$3 billion in overall revenue last year.The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a lives tream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries.While proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world???s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal gray area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Chinese law forbids Chinese from gambling online and at home. The Chinese Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cybergambling is harmful to the country???s economic security, image and stability.However, proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, last month told reporters that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and South Koreans wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year.The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.",2

Edward Jones & Co analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ???The good thing is, Coach has been through this before and shown they can be successful.???Heavy discounting by wholesale customers has hurt the cachet of brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, which sell mostly through their own stores and online.To fight back, they are trying to move fewer products through discounters such as TJ Maxx and department stores, which have been slashing prices on luxury handbags to cope with slower mall traffic.Coach on Monday said it would buy Kate Spade as part of its strategy to build a multi-brand lifestyle company from New York, where both companies are based. Known for its whimsical handbag designs, Kate Spade has been successful at luring millennials, who make up 60 percent of its customers.Kate Spade had become ???too dependent on the overly promotional channels of online flash sales and wholesale disposition,??? Coach chief executive officer Victor Luis said.To boost its own margins, Coach has been adding more handbags to its luxury 1941 line and stepping up store services to draw shoppers who are willing to pay top dollar.Coach???s comparable-store sales in North America rose 3 percent in the first quarter, the fourth consecutive gain and above the 1.4 percent increase predicted by analysts.Gross margins expanded 1.9 percentage points year-on-year to 70.9 percent.Coach has also said sales of items priced at more than US$400 now make up 55 percent of handbag sales in North America, an increase from 40 percent posted during the same period last year. The results, delivered last week, sent the stock surging 11 percent, its biggest daily gain in more than six years.Coach, Kate Spade and their rival Michael Kors Holdings Ltd still have work to do to whittle down the excess inventory at retailers.

Office, the Taiwan High Court in September last year upheld a lower court???s guilty verdict against Ho, handing down a suspended sentence of three months for death through negligence, which could be reduced to a NT$90,000 fine.Ho has insisted that he acted properly to defend his pregnant wife when Chang broke into their residence in October 2014.Ho kept Chang in a choke hold until the police arrived 10 minutes after being called.By the time the police arrived, Chang had lost consciousness, and he later died at a local hospital.Reviewing the evidence, the judges said Chang suffered from a cardiovascular condition and could not endure a long deprivation from oxygen, and that Ho???s tight choke hold had caused internal bleeding in the neck region.They concluded that Ho???s actions had directly led to Chang???s death.???This is a very unfair decision and I cannot accept it. I will definitely appeal it, because it is an injustice,??? Ho told reporters.???The burglar broke into my house first. How could I know whether he was carrying weapons or had brought accomplices???? Ho said.In heated discussions on the Web, most posts voiced support for Ho and decried the judges for punishing a courageous man for acting in justified self-defense because he wanted to protect his wife, who was eight months pregnant at the time.Some netizens wrote that Ho and his family were the actual victims and should not have to pay any compensation, since Chang was a criminal who broke into their home.One person wrote: ???Is the court encouraging burglars?

5570,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature. The infrastructure bill has been heavily criticized by civic groups and academics alike over assessment criteria, planning and selection of projects, financial impact and feasibility.",2

5620,Business,"Taiwan???s notebook shipments in the first quarter rose 6.3 percent year-on-year, their first uptick since the final quarter of 2014, the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC, ??¢F?¢D??????¡Ó?????????) said on Friday.The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc???s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (??¡Ó??????) said.Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said.Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said.Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight  designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year???s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays.Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China.A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said.The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand.Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed.While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc???s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp???s Kraby Lake, the institute said.However, AMD???s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said.The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses.As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.",2
5652,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,??? DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (?????????) said.???The founding philosophy of the WHA is health for all, but the reality is health for all except for Taiwanese,??? Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation. Is the KMT speaking for China or Taiwan???? Wang said.There should be no preconditions for WHA membership, and using membership as political leverage runs counter to the principles on which the WHO is founded, Lo said.Taiwan is an important contributor to global immunization and disaster relief, and the nation???s health insurance system ensures quality and affordable healthcare to all citizens, which has been closely studied by governments and international medical bodies, DPP Legislator and TMA president Chiu Tai-yuan (??¡Ó??¢X???) said.Taiwan is ranked first in Asia and sixth in the world in terms of palliative care, and this global leader in healthcare and medicine should not be excluded from the WHA for political reasons, Chiu said.China has also attempted to pressure the World Medical Association (WMA) to rename the TMA the ???Taiwan China Medical Association,??? TMA secretary-general Wang Bi-sheng (?????????) said.The Chinese association issued a written request during the WMA general assembly in Zambia last month for the name change, but the request was rejected because WMA members understood that the TMA is a non-political body and the issue should not be treated politically, Wang said.???China had made informal proposals to change the name of the TMA, but it was the first time it issued a written request. It is expected that China will make another formal request at the general assembly in October,??? Wang said.",2

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,???

5817,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations.

6018,Bilingual Pages,"The technology for the URABat, an ultrafast rechargeable aluminum battery developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a leading technology research institution in Taiwan, has won a silver medal at the 2017 Edison Awards held in New York on April 20. The URABat was honored in the Energy & Sustainability/Power Source category at the awards.In the past two years, several private Taiwanese companies have been shortlisted for the awards, which were established in 1987. However this year is the first time that the ITRI has participated in the competition and been recognized with an award.Developed in collaboration with Stanford University since 2013, the URABat has achieved three breakthroughs, including finding the perfect combination of aluminum and graphite for the battery cell and making a battery cell that can be mass-produced for various needs and to various specifications.A 48V/1Ah aluminum battery installed in an electric bicycle for road tests acheived a full charge within 6 minutes, 20 times faster than conventional lead-acid batteries. The battery is made of highly stable graphite and aluminum materials and does not combust when damaged.The development of URABat was published in the journal Nature in 2015, and in 2016 it won the R&D; 100 Awards.???URABat is expected to offer a new power storage alternative that will have a huge impact on the world,??? said the head of the ITRI delegation, Dr. Yang Chang-chung, Deputy Division Director of ITRI???s Green Energy and Environment Research Labs.???There has never been a significant development in battery technology quite like the ITRI,??? commented Frank Bonafilia, executive director of the Edison Awards.TODAY???S WORDS ?????¢D??????1. rechargeable adj.??¡Â?????????

6027,Taiwan News,"Money saved from getting rid of preferential savings rate accounts for retired public employees should be plowed back into the nation???s pension funds, a teachers??? union said yesterday as the Legislative Yuan began review of bills on  reforming teachers??? pension.???There is only one criterion as we look at reform ??? whether or not any money that is saved is entirely plowed into the pensions funds,??? National Federation of Teachers Unions deputy secretary-general Lo Te-shui (?????¡P?¢X?) said.While the Executive Yuan???s reform proposal includes the critical provision, some versions proposed by Democratic Progressive Party legislators do not.A committee review of pension reform for civil servants last week struck out a similar provision from the government-sponsored bill, he added.Eliminating retirees??? access to preferential savings rate accounts offering above market interest rates is a major source of savings under government sponsored reform.However, because such interest is now paid out of the annual budgets of the retirees??? former agencies, the savings will not do much to stave off the pending bankruptcy of the pension funds without a specific mandate increasing proportional government contributions to the funds, he said.???We cannot accept pension reform which devolves into local governments skimming off profits from the cuts,??? he said.Legislation should codify government promises to set up new accounts within the pension funds to ensure that the savings are used to pay the pensions of future retirees, Lo said.He also criticized proposals that would allow the government to adjust pensions ??? without legislative approval ??? when changes to the government???s finances and the national economy require it.Only revisions tied to the consumer price index should be allowed, he said.???[Otherwise] this would probably lead to continual changes,??? Lo said. ???They could tamper with pensions almost at whim.???Union president Chang Hsu-cheng (?????????) called for more flexibility in determining teachers??? retirement age, saying that each teacher???s eligibility should be based on a combination of age and years of service rather than fixed at 60 years of age as the Executive Yuan???s bill stipulates.Absolute ceilings on the pension ???replacement ratios??? relative to teachers??? original salaries would discourage teachers from working longer, Chang said.As pension replacement ratios are calculated based on teachers??? years of service, the fixed ceilings would penalize any teachers who work longer than 35 years, he said.The union also called for Public Employee Insurance to be excluded from the pension ceiling on the grounds that its fund is not expected to go bankrupt anytime soon, unlike the teachers??? general pension fund.",2

Chang said, adding that Taipower has submitted an evaluation report about the incident, which was posted on the council???s Web site.However, many environmentalists at the forum doubted whether Taipower told the truth.The coastdown might implicate a security crisis that can be described as ???hitting the brake and the accelerator at the same time,??? said He Li-wei (?????????), a former researcher at the AEC Institute of Nuclear Energy Research.???[The coastdown] has extended [the reactor???s] operation for another 15 days, but did not generate any more electricity,???

Department of Statistics Director-General Beatrice Tsai (?????????) said.The Chinese market accounted for 39.5 percent of Taiwanese exports and 50 percent of all electronics shipments, Tsai said.Electronics underpinned exports with a 31.4 percent contribution last month, led by demand for semiconductors, Tsai said, citing the ministry???s monthly report.Imports of semiconductor equipment rose 80.9 percent last month from a year earlier, indicating that growth momentum for semiconductors remain strong, Tsai said.Imports expanded at a faster pace of 23.5 percent to US$21.53 billion last month from a year earlier, shrinking the trade surplus to US$2.78 billion, a decrease of 41.9 percent from the same period last year, the report showed.The trend could help downsize the nation???s current account surplus, one of the main reasons the US Department of the Treasury keeps Taiwan on its currency monitoring list.Exports to all major trading partners rose and all product categories registered increases, with the exception of textile products due to a seasonal slowdown, the report said.Shipments to ASEAN markets gained faster momentum, rising 14.1 percent year-on-year to US$4.59 billion last month, the report said, as Taiwanese firms increasingly shift production activity to Southeast Asia.The migration has helped spur demand for Taiwanese machinery tools, which might receive a further boost as more manufacturers worldwide replace human labor with automation to improve productivity and cut labor costs, Tsai said.For the first four months of the year, exports expanded 13.6 percent to US$96.42 billion, while imports gained 22.1 percent to US$82.86 billion, the report said.The cumulative trade surplus amounted to US$13.56 billion, a drop of 20.4 percent from the same period last year.Tsai declined to speculate on inventory demand related to Apple Inc???s next-generation mobile devices, saying local firms have not given any clues and the ministry is not in a position to tell.Foreign-exchange volatility and growing competition from Chinese exporters pose downside risks, she said.",2

These are just some examples of Taiwan???s world-class medical achievements, breakthroughs and international contributions.Having been on the receiving end of the international community???s assistance eradicating several communicable diseases, Taiwan, now a nation with advanced medicine and healthcare, is eager to contribute to better global health.However, its eagerness has been rejected by the WHO.The World Health Assembly (WHA), the organization???s highest decisionmaking body, is to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, from May 22 to 31 and yesterday was the last day for online registration to the annual conference. As of press time last night, Taiwan had not been invited.China???s Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun (?????????) yesterday said that so long as Taiwan refuses ???the fundamental condition,??? which he described as the recognition of the ???one China??? principle and the so-called ???1992 consensus,??? there is no basis for Taiwan???s participation in the WHA, or other international organizations for that matter.While China???s bullying is reprehensible, it is just as disappointing to see that the WHO is indifferent to the fact that its autonomy has been usurped by China.The WHO???s objective is ???to build a better, healthier future for people all over the world,??? its Web site says. It says that it ???remains firmly committed to the principles set out in the preamble to the Constitution. Among the principles enshrined in the WHO Constitution include: The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition; The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest co-operation of individuals and States; The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all; and Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of diseases, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.???Against the backdrop of its mission and constitution, is the WHO being hypocritical? Why is an international organization spearheading the global response to epidemic prevention allowing China to hold health concerns of 23 million people in Taiwan to ransom?Those who argue that Taiwan is not a ???state??? and therefore cannot taken part in the WHO should know that statehood is not required for observer status to the WHA and related bodies.By yielding to China, the WHO is jeopardizing the global epidemic prevention network; by discriminating against Taiwan, the WHO is essentially allowing the global healthcare network to be broken, especially since Taiwan is in such close proximity to China, which is notorious for concealing epidemics.",2
6073,World News,"China and the Philippines have joined forces to tackle illegal gambling, part of Beijing???s broader campaign to curb illicit capital outflows and a pledge by Manila to weed out unscrupulous operators from the country???s booming gaming industry.The coordinated crackdown comes amid warming ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) and his Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made illegal gambling the third front in his all-out war on crime, after drugs and corruption.In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities last month cracked a transnational cybergambling operation, shutting four illegal Web sites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China???s Public Security Bureau said.Philippines National Bureau of Investigation cybercrime division chief Martini Cruz told reporters authorities were preparing further raids for this month targeting illegal betting and online fraud originating in the Philippines and targeted at Chinese gamblers.???We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,??? Cruz said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly US$3 billion in overall revenue last year.The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a lives tream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries.While proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world???s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal gray area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Chinese law forbids Chinese from gambling online and at home. The Chinese Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cybergambling is harmful to the country???s economic security, image and stability.However, proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, last month told reporters that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and South Koreans wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year.The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.",2

Edward Jones & Co analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ???The good thing is, Coach has been through this before and shown they can be successful.???Heavy discounting by wholesale customers has hurt the cachet of brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, which sell mostly through their own stores and online.To fight back, they are trying to move fewer products through discounters such as TJ Maxx and department stores, which have been slashing prices on luxury handbags to cope with slower mall traffic.Coach on Monday said it would buy Kate Spade as part of its strategy to build a multi-brand lifestyle company from New York, where both companies are based. Known for its whimsical handbag designs, Kate Spade has been successful at luring millennials, who make up 60 percent of its customers.Kate Spade had become ???too dependent on the overly promotional channels of online flash sales and wholesale disposition,???

Office, the Taiwan High Court in September last year upheld a lower court???s guilty verdict against Ho, handing down a suspended sentence of three months for death through negligence, which could be reduced to a NT$90,000 fine.Ho has insisted that he acted properly to defend his pregnant wife when Chang broke into their residence in October 2014.Ho kept Chang in a choke hold until the police arrived 10 minutes after being called.By the time the police arrived, Chang had lost consciousness, and he later died at a local hospital.Reviewing the evidence, the judges said Chang suffered from a cardiovascular condition and could not endure a long deprivation from oxygen, and that Ho???s tight choke hold had caused internal bleeding in the neck region.They concluded that Ho???s actions had directly led to Chang???s death.???This is a very unfair decision and I cannot accept it.

We hope we will continue to have support in making arms purchases to ensure we can undertake this responsibility,??? the sources said.The numbering of the frigates ??? 1112 and 1115 ??? follows a convention in which the last two numbers of a ship???s name cannot add up to four, nor can the last digit be a four, the official said.Case of all the digits adding up to four are also not used.Four in Chinese has a similar pronunciation to the Chinese word for ???die??? (si, ???).???The idea is that we hope officers will not be distracted by what might be perceived as an ominous ship name,??? the official said, adding that as the previous Cheng Kung-class vessel to be added to the fleet was No. 1110, and 1111 adds up to four, the new ships were numbered starting from 1112.",2

FedEx said in a statement.Only a small number of US-headquartered organizations were hit, because the hackers appear to have begun the campaign by targeting organizations in Europe, said Vikram Thakur, research manager with security software maker Symantec.By the time they turned their attention to the US, spam filters had identified the new threat and flagged the ransomware-laden e-mails as malicious, Thakur said.Infections of the worm appeared to have fallen off significantly after a security researcher bought a domain that the malware was connecting to, by chance undermining its effectiveness.???The numbers are extremely low and coming down fast,??? he said, but added that any change in the original code could lead to another flare up.The US Department of Homeland Security said late on Friday that it was aware of reports of the ransomware, was sharing information with domestic and foreign partners, and was ready to lend technical support.Telecom company Telefonica was among many targets in Spain, though it said the attack was limited to some computers on an internal network and had not affected clients or services.Portugal Telecom and Telefonica Argentina both said they were also targeted.Private security firms identified the ransomware as a new variant of ???WannaCry??? that had the ability to automatically spread across large networks by exploiting a known bug in Microsoft???s Windows operating system.The hackers, who have not come forward to claim responsibility or otherwise been identified, likely made it a ???worm,??? or self-spreading malware, by exploiting a piece of NSA code known as ???Eternal Blue??? that was released last month by a group known as the Shadow Brokers, researchers with several private cybersecurity firms said.???This is one of the largest global ransomware attacks the cybercommunity has ever seen,??? said Rich Barger, director of threat research with Splunk, one of the firms that linked WannaCry to the NSA.",2

6351,Taiwan News,"The Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee on Wednesday accused the National Women???s League of breaching tax exemption requirements for nonprofit organizations, calling it ???a possible serial tax dodger.???Citing National Tax Bureau documents, committee spokeswoman Shih Chin-fang (?????????) said the league owed the government back taxes of NT$3 million (US$99,334) for 1997, NT$516 million for 2011 and NT$40 million this year.To be tax exempt, a nonprofit must use at least 60 percent of its revenue from the interest of its fund and other sources of income for its stated purpose, according to the Rules Governing the Income Tax-exempt Status of Educational, Cultural, Public Welfare and Charitable Organizations or Institutions (??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????).Shih said the league relied on the regulation for its tax-exempt status, and exactly how it had incurred back taxes is not yet clear.The committee has found other irregularities in the league???s financial documents from 2015, when it reported NT$350 million in revenue and NT$220 million in expenditures, of which NT$30 million were pension-related expenditures.The league???s pension expenditures in 2015 were considerably higher than in previous years, which ranged from several hundred thousand New Taiwanese dollars to several million, she said.The inclusion of pension-related spending as part of ???expenditures for its stated purpose??? to meet its exemption requirement was a ???questionable??? accounting decision, Shih said.The league might owe substantial back taxes for 2015, she said.The committee also believes that the National Women???s League Foundation for the Hearing Impaired had breached exemption requirements, she said.In 2012, the Ministry of Finance ruled that the foundation was in breach of exemption requirements and demanded that it pay back taxes, Shih said.However, the Ministry of Education ??? the then-managing authority of the foundation ??? allowed the foundation to make up the shortfall in its purpose-driven expenditures over a four-year period, thereby allowing the foundation to remain tax-exempt, she said.Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen Chi-mai (?????????) accused the league of failing to spend an appropriate share of its expenditures on charity to comply with tax-exemption requirements.The league also failed to pay taxes on its interest-derived income. In 2008 the interest income was NT$850 million, he said.He added that the tax bureau found that the league failed to file its business income tax for 2011 and had later paid after filing NT$516 million in business income tax.Between 2012 and 2015, the league???s loan interest amounted to at least NT$310 million per year, which had accumulated NT$62 million in back taxes on the interest income over the four years, and it was not completely repaid until last year, Chen said.???The tax bureau in 2011 billed the league for NT$516 million in back taxes, which means that it knew about the league???s tax dodging for years,??? he said.The league was registered as a political organization in 1990 and its charter has no provisions for liquidating its assets if it is dissolved, which should have disqualified it for tax exemption, Chen said.The league has refused to change its charter and resorted to paying back taxes, proving it wants to hide assets from public oversight, he said.",2

6436,Editorials,"The nation???s economy started out moderately strong in the first quarter of the year, with GDP increasing 2.56 percent year-on-year. While the number is lower than the peak of 2.88 percent growth registered in the final quarter of last year, it is higher than the average of 2.49 percent seen in the second half of last year, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.In seasonally adjusted terms, the latest data also suggest the economy is on course for a modest but solid recovery, with the economy expanding 0.72 percent quarterly and 2.93 percent annually in the past quarter, better than the 0.45 percent and 1.82 percent seen in the previous quarter.External demand and domestic investment remained important drivers of economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to a recovery in the global economy. However, the positive effects have been diluted due to the New Taiwan dollar???s 6 percent appreciation versus the US dollar over the quarter, with annual increases in real exports and imports both coming in lower than February estimates of 6.99 percent and 7.15 percent respectively.On the positive side, several leading indicators, such as the manufacturing purchasing managers??? index and industrial production index, still point to an upward trend in economic activity over the coming months, implying that the improvement in capital formation could continue amid companies??? demand for machinery and other capital goods, supporting economic growth. However, it is worth noting that the recovery in external demand did not help boost domestic consumption in the first quarter.The DGBAS data showed that private consumption reported subpar growth of 1.62 percent year-on-year, flat from the previous quarter???s level, but lower than the statistics agency???s February forecast, making some economists think that consumer confidence has continued to languish amid weak employment prospects and concerns about controversial domestic policy changes including pension reform and revision of work week rules.Private consumption still contributed 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, but its strength was overshadowed by weakness in government consumption. Government consumption contracted 4.67 percent year-on-year in the quarter and chipped 0.66 percentage points off the nation???s economic growth, DGBAS data showed.Should domestic demand be expected to pick up? It is challenging for ordinary people to spend large sums of money in view of muted real wage growth, the negative effects of a rapidly aging society and heavy financial burdens due to housing costs.While there are signs of improvement in the property market, with both housing prices and transaction volumes picking up in Taipei, it remains unclear whether this will be reflected in a positive wealth effect on consumption.On the other hand, the anticipated contribution from the government???s NT$880 billion (US$29.1 billion) infrastructure plan is unlikely to be felt until the end of this year at the earliest, as the draft bill regulating the investment has run into opposition in the legislature.

6486,Business,"Taiwan???s notebook shipments in the first quarter rose 6.3 percent year-on-year, their first uptick since the final quarter of 2014, the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC, ??¢F?¢D??????¡Ó?????????) said on Friday.The gain was attributed to strong replacement demand for commercial laptops and Apple Inc???s MacBooks, MIC researcher Jessica Hsu (??¡Ó??????) said.Global laptop sales are expected to reach 154 million units this year as the pace of a decline in demand slows, Hsu said.Companies have launched new models with improved biometric security features, such as infrared camera-enabled facial recognition, encryption for payment services such as PayPal and longer battery lives, Hsu said.Laptop designs are also trending toward thinner display bezels, and more portable and lightweight  designs are aimed at attracting upgrade purchases, Hsu said, adding that this year???s gaming laptop models also have new processors and displays.Companies will take lower-priced models off the market as rising DRAM prices and a shortage of solid-state drives adds to production costs, Hsu said, adding that a shortage of display panels has been mitigated by rising production capacity in China.A rise in sales of higher-margin business and gaming laptops is expected to slow the pace of falling average retail prices of laptops this year, Hsu said.The institute gave a dim outlook for motherboards, saying that a new generation of processors would not catalyze demand.Motherboard shipments in the first quarter fell 6.7 percent sequentially to 26 million units, MIC data showed.While the launch of new central processing units is no longer a major sales driver, AMD Inc???s Ryzen has seen a warmer market reception since its debut at the beginning of the year than Intel Corp???s Kraby Lake, the institute said.However, AMD???s smaller market share would bring limited gains to global motherboard shipments this year, it said.The institute said that as the global market for motherboards contracts, companies have voiced a willingness to refrain from capturing market share on lower pricing and instead focus on higher-margin segments, such as gaming, as well as branching out to other businesses.As the market continues to contract, motherboard makers seeking to transition to higher-margin product lines would face balancing market share and maintaining profitability challenging, while second-tier companies are likely to see diminished bargaining power with their suppliers, the institute said.",2
6518,World News,"Matteo Renzi, staging a political comeback less than five months after resigning as Italy???s prime minister, on Sunday easily regained the leadership of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) with an overwhelming victory in a primary election among party supporters.According to partial results, Renzi had about 72 percent of the vote, held in makeshift polling booths around the country.About 2 million party members voted in the primary.Italian Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando had 19 percent while Michele Emiliano, the governor of the southern Puglia region, had about 9 percent.Both of his opponents, as well as Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, called to congratulate him, and Renzi gave a long victory speech at party headquarters.???Forward together,??? Renzi said to applause.Renzi, 42, resigned as prime minister in December last year after a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reforms aimed at streamlining lawmaking.He was replaced by Gentiloni, the then-Italian minister of foreign affairs, but he quickly began planning a comeback.With a national vote due by May next year, polls show the ruling PD has slipped behind the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which questions the country???s euro membership.Renzi???s ability to counter the Five Star surge might be crucial to fending off an existential threat to the eurozone.However, under Italy???s proportional representation voting system, no party looks likely to win enough seats in parliament to govern alone.Renzi, with his confrontational leadership style, has become a divisive figure, and there is no guarantee he would be named prime minister of a coalition government even if the PD were to win the most votes during the election.While Renzi remains the most popular politician among PD voters, the party and his own appeal look much weaker than during his heyday as Italian prime minister, after he failed to convert his ambitious reform agenda into reality.Renzi???s personal approval rating is about half of the 50 percent he posted three years ago, according to the Ixe polling institute.Polls show Five Star has about 30 percent of the vote and a lead of between 3 and 8 percentage points over the PD after a dispute between Renzi???s loyalists and left-wing traditionalists caused a party split in February.???I voted for Renzi because he???s got more drive and determination than the others, but I???m not convinced he???ll get back into government,??? said computer engineer Luigi Mancini, a PD supporter in Rimini on the Adriatic coast.???With the [proportional representation] voting system we???ve got, it seems unlikely that anyone will get a majority,??? he added.",2

The WHO secretariat has not yet issued an invitation to Taiwan.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus and the Taiwan Medical Association (TMA) yesterday urged the WHO to issue the invitation by the registration deadline on Monday next week.???The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHA is political and health apartheid, an act of injustice by Beijing,??? DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (?????????) said.???The founding philosophy of the WHA is health for all, but the reality is health for all except for Taiwanese,??? Lo said.President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) said in an interview last week that the WHA meeting would be an important indicator of relations between Taiwan and China, and Beijing should understand the implication of Taiwan???s absence from the WHA on cross-strait relations, Lo said.???Many WHA members support Taiwan???s participation and Beijing???s intervention has destabilized international peace,??? Lo said.The SARS epidemic in 2003 is proof that diseases are not bound by borders and Taiwan???s exclusion from the WHA would create a loophole in the global disease prevention network, he added.DPP Legislator Wang Ding-yu (?????????) slammed the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for asking the government to accept the so-called ???1992 consensus??? to ensure WHA invitation.The ???1992 consensus??? refers to a tacit understanding between the KMT and the Chinese government that both sides of the Taiwan Strait acknowledge there is ???one China,??? with each side having its own interpretation of what that means.???The acceptance of the 1992 consensus and its ???one China??? framework would make Taiwan a part of Beijing???s delegation. Is the KMT speaking for China or Taiwan???? Wang said.There should be no preconditions for WHA membership, and using membership as political leverage runs counter to the principles on which the WHO is founded, Lo said.Taiwan is an important contributor to global immunization and disaster relief, and the nation???s health insurance system ensures quality and affordable healthcare to all citizens, which has been closely studied by governments and international medical bodies, DPP Legislator and TMA president Chiu Tai-yuan (??¡Ó??¢X???) said.Taiwan is ranked first in Asia and sixth in the world in terms of palliative care, and this global leader in healthcare and medicine should not be excluded from the WHA for political reasons, Chiu said.China has also attempted to pressure the World Medical Association (WMA) to rename the TMA the ???Taiwan China Medical Association,??? TMA secretary-general Wang Bi-sheng (?????????) said.The Chinese association issued a written request during the WMA general assembly in Zambia last month for the name change, but the request was rejected because WMA members understood that the TMA is a non-political body and the issue should not be treated politically, Wang said.???China had made informal proposals to change the name of the TMA, but it was the first time it issued a written request. It is expected that China will make another formal request at the general assembly in October,??? Wang said.",2

The replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees would be lowered from 65 percent to 50 percent and the replacement ratio of other appointees would be lowered from 75 percent to 60 percent.The Examination Yuan???s proposals seek smaller cuts, with the replacement ratio of ministerial-level appointees to be lowered from 65 percent to 55 percent over 10 years and that of other appointees to be lowered from 80 percent to 70 percent.In terms of phasing out the 18 percent preferential savings rate, the Executive Yuan???s version would exempt appointees who receive a monthly pension of less than NT$32,160, while the Examination Yuan???s proposal would allow ministerial appointees to retain the preferential rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 55 percent over the course of pension reform and other appointees would retain the 18 percent saving rate should their income replacement rate drop to less than 70 percent.In terms of qualification for survivor benefits, the Executive Yuan???s proposal stipulates that underage children or the spouse of a deceased political appointee can receive half the monthly pension paid to the appointee, but the spouse must be aged 65 or older and had been married to the appointee for at least 15 years.The Examination Yuan???s version has similar requirements for survivor benefits, except that spouses would be entitled to the benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least 10 years.In terms of civil servants??? and teachers??? pensions, the Executive Yuan???s proposal differs from the Examination Yuan???s only in the category of survivor benefits.The Examination Yuan???s amendment would entitle the widows or widowers of deceased civil servants or teachers to survivor benefits if they are aged 55 or older and had been married for at least two years, while the Executive Yuan???s version sets the age limit at 65 with a marriage duration of at least 15 years.The draft amendments prepared by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan are to be jointly reviewed by the legislature.",2

BMW chief financial officer Nicolas Peter said in the statement, noting that spending on electric technologies and autonomous features would also be high. ???Short-term gain is not the decisive factor for us: we remain focused on sustainable, profitable growth.???Weighed down by rising expenses, BMW has maintained a cautious approach even after Daimler???s Mercedes-Benz surged past it in sales last year for the first time in more than a decade.The first steps of BMW seeking to fight back were evident in March, when Krueger outlined plans for 40 new and revamped models.The offensive includes the X2, a compact sport utility vehicle scheduled for next year, as well as the full-size X7.Selling more of the lucrative SUVs and top-of-the-line sedans ??? alongside the revamped bread-and-butter 5 Series ??? is vital as the manufacturer aims to boost profitability.BMW???s new flagship, the self-driving electric iNext, is due for release in 2021.The company???s profit from automaking rose 6.1 percent in the first quarter to 1.87 billion euros (US$2 billion) on the back of climbing sales, the automaker said in the statement, describing the growth as ???significant.??????Despite this stronger-than-expected start to the year, BMW has opted for a conservative approach,???

6683,Editorials,"When President Tsai Ing-wen (?????¡Ó???) first started teaching at National Chengchi University after returning to Taiwan from the UK in 1984, she often walked the corridors with her head down.After joining the bureaucracy, she served as Taiwan???s top negotiator in the talks about Taiwan???s accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO, and she also served as Mainland Affairs Council minister, legislator and vice premier, but she always maintained the approach of a bureaucrat.It was not until she took over the chairmanship of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2008 that she gradually gained experience as a manager and supervisor, but it was evident to all that she was neither a charismatic nor a creative politician.As a politician, she is conservative in her approach and her victory in last year???s presidential election was to a great extent the result of a changing context.The ongoing pension and judicial reforms as well as the transitional justice process are extremely difficult and complex issues. During the final years of the Qianlong emperor???s rule during China???s Qing Dynasty, the emperor???s favorite official, Heshen (??????), was accused of corruption. Since it was not an easy problem to solve, he left the matter to his son, the Jiaqing emperor, to deal with.When Tiberius Gracchus, a plebeian tribune in ancient Rome, tried to push for land reform, he sacrificed his life as he was beaten to death in a chaotic situation, a victim of reform. The Qianlong emperor and Gracchus were afraid that vested interests would counterattack, but because the two handled their problems differently, the end results were also different.During the rule of Zhao Kuangyin (?????????) ??? the Taizu emperor of the Song Dynasty ??? he suddenly dismissed many military leaders during a banquet. During the rule of Zhu Yuanzhang (??¡Ó??????) ??? the Hongwu emperor of the Ming Dynasty ??? many founding ministers with great achievements were killed. Although the two successfully wrested back power, their reigns were authoritarian and do not serve as good examples.The reformist Wang Anshi (?????????) pushed for reform during the Song Dynasty, but failed, as did the Qing Dynasty???s Guangxu emperor when he attempted to carry out his so-called ???100-day reforms.??? These examples all show how difficult reform can be.The most successful reform in Chinese history was statesman Shang Yang???s (??????) launch of a new legal system in the State of Qin during the Warring States period, and that was because the time and social conditions were ripe for the change.The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government implemented a number of successful policies in Taiwan, such as the ???land to the tiller??? in 1953 and the introduction of the New Taiwan dollar at the rate of one NT dollar to 40,000 old dollars in 1949. However, it was only able to succeed thanks to the support of the military.In modern times, successful judicial reform and transitional justice in nations such as Germany, Spain and South Africa could all serve as good examples for Taiwan.Tsai???s reforms are moving in the right direction, but her administration is rather conservative in its approach, approval ratings are not high and the social conditions for reform are not ripe. As a result, she is frequently too cautious in her approach to reform and is only progressing gradually, which is probably the safest way at the moment.",2

Lin adopted his economic policy advisers??? suggestion to have Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency chief investment officer David Weng (?????????) double as CEO of the new company.Based on the same reports, the government is to establish a preparatory office for the new national investment corporation by the end of this month.With initial paid-in capital of NT$250 million (US$8.28 million), the new company is to emphasize development of the so-called ???five plus two??? innovative industries: ???green??? energy, national defense, biotechnology, ???smart??? machinery and the Internet of Things, as well as promotion of a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. It will also focus on promising start-ups with valuable technologies.The company is expected to function as a kind of management consulting firm and manage three investment funds with a total value of NT$10 billion. As the government aims to partner with private investors and business leaders in operating this new investment corporation, it is to provide less than 40 percent of the initial investment in the company, with the remaining 60 percent or more to come from the private sector.It is now possible to piece together some facts about the national investment corporation, such as its operational model, shareholder structure and investment goals. As the government would not be the largest shareholder, it would likely be run by private-sector professionals to maximize returns and keep management flexible while minimizing bureaucratic indolence and inefficiency.The new institution is envisioned to become a major driver of industrial innovation, transformation and technological advancement. However, several details, such as the sources of capital, supervisory mechanisms, organizational regulations and post-investment management have yet to be fleshed out.There are still other questions and it is no wonder that some industry watchers have cast doubt on the effectiveness of the plan. For instance, as Taiwan already has a National Development Fund, which cooperates with local and foreign venture capital firms to finance Taiwanese start-ups, what would set apart the new corporation???s investment strategies and financial operations? Will there be an effective mechanism that can help coordinate the activities of the two to avoid overlapping with their investments? And will NT$10 billion be enough to achieve the goal of encouraging start-up growth?Even so, the plan promises to help local start-ups with strong potential that lack sufficient investment and mentorship to expand their operations.

The URABat was honored in the Energy & Sustainability/Power Source category at the awards.In the past two years, several private Taiwanese companies have been shortlisted for the awards, which were established in 1987. However this year is the first time that the ITRI has participated in the competition and been recognized with an award.Developed in collaboration with Stanford University since 2013, the URABat has achieved three breakthroughs, including finding the perfect combination of aluminum and graphite for the battery cell and making a battery cell that can be mass-produced for various needs and to various specifications.A 48V/1Ah aluminum battery installed in an electric bicycle for road tests acheived a full charge within 6 minutes, 20 times faster than conventional lead-acid batteries. The battery is made of highly stable graphite and aluminum materials and does not combust when damaged.The development of URABat was published in the journal Nature in 2015, and in 2016 it won the R&D; 100 Awards.???URABat is expected to offer a new power storage alternative that will have a huge impact on the world,??? said the head of the ITRI delegation, Dr. Yang Chang-chung, Deputy Division Director of ITRI???s Green Energy and Environment Research Labs.???There has never been a significant development in battery technology quite like the ITRI,??? commented Frank Bonafilia, executive director of the Edison Awards.TODAY???S WORDS ?????¢D??????1. rechargeable adj.??¡Â?????????

6893,Taiwan News,"Money saved from getting rid of preferential savings rate accounts for retired public employees should be plowed back into the nation???s pension funds, a teachers??? union said yesterday as the Legislative Yuan began review of bills on  reforming teachers??? pension.???There is only one criterion as we look at reform ??? whether or not any money that is saved is entirely plowed into the pensions funds,??? National Federation of Teachers Unions deputy secretary-general Lo Te-shui (?????¡P?¢X?) said.While the Executive Yuan???s reform proposal includes the critical provision, some versions proposed by Democratic Progressive Party legislators do not.A committee review of pension reform for civil servants last week struck out a similar provision from the government-sponsored bill, he added.Eliminating retirees??? access to preferential savings rate accounts offering above market interest rates is a major source of savings under government sponsored reform.However, because such interest is now paid out of the annual budgets of the retirees??? former agencies, the savings will not do much to stave off the pending bankruptcy of the pension funds without a specific mandate increasing proportional government contributions to the funds, he said.???We cannot accept pension reform which devolves into local governments skimming off profits from the cuts,??? he said.Legislation should codify government promises to set up new accounts within the pension funds to ensure that the savings are used to pay the pensions of future retirees, Lo said.He also criticized proposals that would allow the government to adjust pensions ??? without legislative approval ??? when changes to the government???s finances and the national economy require it.Only revisions tied to the consumer price index should be allowed, he said.???[Otherwise] this would probably lead to continual changes,??? Lo said. ???They could tamper with pensions almost at whim.???Union president Chang Hsu-cheng (?????????) called for more flexibility in determining teachers??? retirement age, saying that each teacher???s eligibility should be based on a combination of age and years of service rather than fixed at 60 years of age as the Executive Yuan???s bill stipulates.Absolute ceilings on the pension ???replacement ratios??? relative to teachers??? original salaries would discourage teachers from working longer, Chang said.As pension replacement ratios are calculated based on teachers??? years of service, the fixed ceilings would penalize any teachers who work longer than 35 years, he said.The union also called for Public Employee Insurance to be excluded from the pension ceiling on the grounds that its fund is not expected to go bankrupt anytime soon, unlike the teachers??? general pension fund.",2

Chang said, adding that Taipower has submitted an evaluation report about the incident, which was posted on the council???s Web site.However, many environmentalists at the forum doubted whether Taipower told the truth.The coastdown might implicate a security crisis that can be described as ???hitting the brake and the accelerator at the same time,??? said He Li-wei (?????????), a former researcher at the AEC Institute of Nuclear Energy Research.???[The coastdown] has extended [the reactor???s] operation for another 15 days, but did not generate any more electricity,???

Department of Statistics Director-General Beatrice Tsai (?????????) said.The Chinese market accounted for 39.5 percent of Taiwanese exports and 50 percent of all electronics shipments, Tsai said.Electronics underpinned exports with a 31.4 percent contribution last month, led by demand for semiconductors, Tsai said, citing the ministry???s monthly report.Imports of semiconductor equipment rose 80.9 percent last month from a year earlier, indicating that growth momentum for semiconductors remain strong, Tsai said.Imports expanded at a faster pace of 23.5 percent to US$21.53 billion last month from a year earlier, shrinking the trade surplus to US$2.78 billion, a decrease of 41.9 percent from the same period last year, the report showed.The trend could help downsize the nation???s current account surplus, one of the main reasons the US Department of the Treasury keeps Taiwan on its currency monitoring list.Exports to all major trading partners rose and all product categories registered increases, with the exception of textile products due to a seasonal slowdown, the report said.Shipments to ASEAN markets gained faster momentum, rising 14.1 percent year-on-year to US$4.59 billion last month, the report said, as Taiwanese firms increasingly shift production activity to Southeast Asia.The migration has helped spur demand for Taiwanese machinery tools, which might receive a further boost as more manufacturers worldwide replace human labor with automation to improve productivity and cut labor costs, Tsai said.For the first four months of the year, exports expanded 13.6 percent to US$96.42 billion, while imports gained 22.1 percent to US$82.86 billion, the report said.The cumulative trade surplus amounted to US$13.56 billion, a drop of 20.4 percent from the same period last year.Tsai declined to speculate on inventory demand related to Apple Inc???s next-generation mobile devices, saying local firms have not given any clues and the ministry is not in a position to tell.Foreign-exchange volatility and growing competition from Chinese exporters pose downside risks, she said.",2

These are just some examples of Taiwan???s world-class medical achievements, breakthroughs and international contributions.Having been on the receiving end of the international community???s assistance eradicating several communicable diseases, Taiwan, now a nation with advanced medicine and healthcare, is eager to contribute to better global health.However, its eagerness has been rejected by the WHO.The World Health Assembly (WHA), the organization???s highest decisionmaking body, is to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, from May 22 to 31 and yesterday was the last day for online registration to the annual conference. As of press time last night, Taiwan had not been invited.China???s Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun (?????????) yesterday said that so long as Taiwan refuses ???the fundamental condition,??? which he described as the recognition of the ???one China??? principle and the so-called ???1992 consensus,??? there is no basis for Taiwan???s participation in the WHA, or other international organizations for that matter.While China???s bullying is reprehensible, it is just as disappointing to see that the WHO is indifferent to the fact that its autonomy has been usurped by China.The WHO???s objective is ???to build a better, healthier future for people all over the world,??? its Web site says. It says that it ???remains firmly committed to the principles set out in the preamble to the Constitution. Among the principles enshrined in the WHO Constitution include: The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition; The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest co-operation of individuals and States; The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all; and Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of diseases, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.???Against the backdrop of its mission and constitution, is the WHO being hypocritical? Why is an international organization spearheading the global response to epidemic prevention allowing China to hold health concerns of 23 million people in Taiwan to ransom?Those who argue that Taiwan is not a ???state??? and therefore cannot taken part in the WHO should know that statehood is not required for observer status to the WHA and related bodies.By yielding to China, the WHO is jeopardizing the global epidemic prevention network; by discriminating against Taiwan, the WHO is essentially allowing the global healthcare network to be broken, especially since Taiwan is in such close proximity to China, which is notorious for concealing epidemics.",2
6939,World News,"China and the Philippines have joined forces to tackle illegal gambling, part of Beijing???s broader campaign to curb illicit capital outflows and a pledge by Manila to weed out unscrupulous operators from the country???s booming gaming industry.The coordinated crackdown comes amid warming ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping (?????????) and his Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made illegal gambling the third front in his all-out war on crime, after drugs and corruption.In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities last month cracked a transnational cybergambling operation, shutting four illegal Web sites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China???s Public Security Bureau said.Philippines National Bureau of Investigation cybercrime division chief Martini Cruz told reporters authorities were preparing further raids for this month targeting illegal betting and online fraud originating in the Philippines and targeted at Chinese gamblers.???We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,??? Cruz said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly US$3 billion in overall revenue last year.The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a lives tream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries.While proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world???s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal gray area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Chinese law forbids Chinese from gambling online and at home. The Chinese Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cybergambling is harmful to the country???s economic security, image and stability.However, proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, last month told reporters that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and South Koreans wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year.The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.",2

Office, the Taiwan High Court in September last year upheld a lower court???s guilty verdict against Ho, handing down a suspended sentence of three months for death through negligence, which could be reduced to a NT$90,000 fine.Ho has insisted that he acted properly to defend his pregnant wife when Chang broke into their residence in October 2014.Ho kept Chang in a choke hold until the police arrived 10 minutes after being called.By the time the police arrived, Chang had lost consciousness, and he later died at a local hospital.Reviewing the evidence, the judges said Chang suffered from a cardiovascular condition and could not endure a long deprivation from oxygen, and that Ho???s tight choke hold had caused internal bleeding in the neck region.They concluded that Ho???s actions had directly led to Chang???s death.???This is a very unfair decision and I cannot accept it.

The company said its gross profit increased to NT$437.16 million in the first quarter, from NT$284.14 million the previous year, while operating profit also rose to NT$76.6 million, from an operating loss of NT$48.17 million the previous year. Lextar said it booked a foreign-exchange loss of NT$50 million in the first quarter, but better cost controls and enhanced efficiency allowed it to raise gross margin to 13.92 percent from 8.38 percent the previous year.CHIPMAKERSIET???s net income slumpsIntelligent Epitaxy Technology Inc (IET, ??¡Ó????¢G?), a supplier of epitaxy-based compound semiconductor wafers, yesterday said its net income fell 25.89 percent year-on-year to NT$17.75 million in the first quarter, or earnings per share of NT$0.49. Revenue for the first three months of this year decreased 16.04 percent from a year earlier to NT$194.31 million, while gross margin dropped 2.47 percentage points to 31.6 percent, the company said.COMMUNICATIONSWistron NeWeb???s profit risesWistron NeWeb Corp (??????), which specializes in designing and manufacturing advanced wireless communication devices, on Thursday posted a first-quarter net profit of NT$578.56 million, up 11.66 percent year-on-year, or earnings per share of NT$1.67. Gross margin was 15.02 percent, but the company???s revenue fell to NT$12.8 billion from NT$13.3 billion in the same period the previous year, as production and shipments of smart-home products were postponed to the second quarter. Wistron NeWeb can expect revenue and earnings to grow this quarter after it began a new smart-home project and increased shipments of higher-margin automotive connected modules, analysts said.STOCK MARKETCombined sales increaseThe combined sales of companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange increased 0.68 percent last month from the previous year on a consolidated basis, driven mainly by firms in the steel, computer and shipping industries.

The aggregate sales of the 836 companies listed on the bourse totaled NT$8.9 trillion in the first four months, up 4.53 percent from the previous year, the exchange said.",2
7190,World News,"Nepal is to hold local elections tomorrow for the first time in 20 years, a major step in the young republic???s difficult transition to democracy more than a decade after the end of its civil war.The government hopes the elections, staggered over two phases, will lead to a general election later in the year.A recent dispute between the poor Himalayan nation???s Maoist-led government and the head of the supreme court had threatened to derail voting.Nepal has suffered from years of political instability since emerging from a decade-long Maoist insurgency that ended in 2006 and the abolition of the monarchy two years later.The nation???s democratic journey took a hit in 2015, when some regional groups rejected a constitution approved by bigger political parties, saying it concentrated power among the hill elite that has long dominated politics.Analysts say the absence of local-level elected government bodies has delayed development work, boosted corruption and undermined efforts to rebuild areas devastated by two earthquakes in 2015, which killed nearly 9,000 people and displaced 3 million.Survivors of the nation???s worst disaster on record still languish in temporary shelters made from tarpaulin sheets and bamboo. The government has been criticized for failing to spend US$4.1 billion pledged for rebuilding.???Politicians are coming to us asking for votes, but we???ll only vote for those who give us a permanent house,??? Bikram Prajapati, 40, said from his zinc-roofed hut in a suburb of the capital, Kathmandu.The final phase of the local elections is set for June 14, when the restive southern plains, home to ethnic minority groups demanding greater representation, will head to the ballot box.Fourteen million Nepalese are eligible to vote.Nepalese Prime Minister Prachanda, a former Maoist rebel commander, is expected to stand down after the vote under a power-sharing deal with Nepali Congress party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.",2

Nepalese Minister of Foreign Affairs Prakash Saran Mahat said at the signing of the deal.Analysts have expressed concern over China???s attempt to take a lead in global commerce, cautioning that an integrated world trade system where the Chinese Communist Party sets the rules could come with serious risks and hidden costs.New York-based Fitch Ratings said that political motivations might trump ???genuine infrastructure needs and commercial logic,??? leading to ???a heightened risk of projects proving unprofitable.???Struggling countries could be saddled with Chinese loans requiring payment regardless of project performance, Fitch Ratings said.In Kathmandu, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Yu Hong (??????) appeared aware of such criticism and described the plan as a ???symphony performed by an orchestra,??? not China???s ???solo show??? in a short speech at the signing ceremony.???The initiative is not going to be China???s solo show.

7208,Front Page,"Two Perry-class guided-missile frigates purchased from the US arrived in Kaohsiung yesterday, an acquisition that the Republic of China (ROC) Navy said will increase its anti-submarine capability.Flying ROC national flags, the vessels, crewed by Taiwanese, sailed into Zuoying Military Harbor in Kaohsiung at about 9:30am, where a welcoming ceremony was held by the military.A commissioning ceremony is slated for July next year, according to military sources.The ships ??? which were cheaper than Taiwanese-made Cheng Kung-class frigates, the design of which is based on Perry-class frigates ??? were built in the 1980s.The navy renamed them Ming Chuan No. 1112 and Feng Chia No. 1115.They are to join the navy???s 146th fleet based on the outlying island of Penghu, from where they are to patrol the Taiwan Strait, the sources said.Perry-class frigates have high mobility and are equipped with the SQQ-89 undersea warfare combat system and the SQR-19 sonar system, both of which the military said would beef up its anti-submarine capabilities.Then-US president Barack Obama signed a bill into law in December 2014 that authorized the sale of four Perry-class frigates to Taiwan.Taipei budgeted about NT$5.5 billion (US$182 million at today???s exchange rate) in 2014 to purchase two of the ships, which were formerly named the USS Taylor (EFG-50) and the USS Gary (EFG-51) of the US Navy.Admiral Huang Shu-kuang (?????????), commander of the ROC Navy, and family members of the crew were at the port to welcome the ships as they docked.An official who declined to be named said the navy had been working with its US counterpart since May last year to bring the ships to Taiwan, adding that the crew underwent 10 months of tests and training with the US military.The frigates are to be fitted with new equipment, while officers will be trained with the new ships before they are added into the naval force, the official said.???Maintaining security and unimpeded passage in the waters around Taiwan is the navy???s greatest responsibility. We hope we will continue to have support in making arms purchases to ensure we can undertake this responsibility,??? the sources said.The numbering of the frigates ??? 1112 and 1115 ??? follows a convention in which the last two numbers of a ship???s name cannot add up to four, nor can the last digit be a four, the official said.Case of all the digits adding up to four are also not used.Four in Chinese has a similar pronunciation to the Chinese word for ???die??? (si, ???).???The idea is that we hope officers will not be distracted by what might be perceived as an ominous ship name,??? the official said, adding that as the previous Cheng Kung-class vessel to be added to the fleet was No. 1110, and 1111 adds up to four, the new ships were numbered starting from 1112.",2
7210,Front Page,"A global cyberattack leveraging hacking tools believed to have been developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) infected tens of thousands of computers in nearly 100 countries, including Taiwan, disrupting Britain???s health system and global shipper FedEx.Extortionists tricked people into opening malware attachments to spam e-mails that appeared to contain invoices, job offers, security warnings and other legitimate files.The ransomware encrypted data on the computers, demanding payments of US$300 to US$600 to restore access.Security researchers said they observed some people paying via the digital currency bitcoin, although they did not know what percent had given in to the extortionists.Researchers with security software maker Avast said they had observed 57,000 infections in 99 countries, with Taiwan, Russia and Ukraine the top targets.Asian countries reported no major breaches yesterday, but officials in the region were scrambling to check and the full extent of the damage might not be known for some time.China???s Xinhua news agency said some secondary schools and universities had been affected, without specifying how many or identifying them.The most disruptive attacks were reported in Britain, where hospitals and clinics were forced to turn away patients after losing access to computers on Friday.International shipper FedEx Corp said some of its Windows computers were also infected.???We are implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible,??? FedEx said in a statement.Only a small number of US-headquartered organizations were hit, because the hackers appear to have begun the campaign by targeting organizations in Europe, said Vikram Thakur, research manager with security software maker Symantec.By the time they turned their attention to the US, spam filters had identified the new threat and flagged the ransomware-laden e-mails as malicious, Thakur said.Infections of the worm appeared to have fallen off significantly after a security researcher bought a domain that the malware was connecting to, by chance undermining its effectiveness.???The numbers are extremely low and coming down fast,??? he said, but added that any change in the original code could lead to another flare up.The US Department of Homeland Security said late on Friday that it was aware of reports of the ransomware, was sharing information with domestic and foreign partners, and was ready to lend technical support.Telecom company Telefonica was among many targets in Spain, though it said the attack was limited to some computers on an internal network and had not affected clients or services.Portugal Telecom and Telefonica Argentina both said they were also targeted.Private security firms identified the ransomware as a new variant of ???WannaCry??? that had the ability to automatically spread across large networks by exploiting a known bug in Microsoft???s Windows operating system.The hackers, who have not come forward to claim responsibility or otherwise been identified, likely made it a ???worm,??? or self-spreading malware, by exploiting a piece of NSA code known as ???Eternal Blue??? that was released last month by a group known as the Shadow Brokers, researchers with several private cybersecurity firms said.???This is one of the largest global ransomware attacks the cybercommunity has ever seen,??? said Rich Barger, director of threat research with Splunk, one of the firms that linked WannaCry to the NSA.",2

Veterans Affairs Council Vice Minister Lu Chia-kai (????????¡Ó) said, adding that the residents had originally leased space in a market constructed by the National Women???s League, which also constructed a military dependents??? village nearby.The market and village were destroyed by a typhoon in 1962, Lu said, adding that while the village was relocated, market residents chose to rebuild.???When people were renting stalls on the property, their occupation was legal,??? he said. ???Illegal occupation began when they chose to remain and rebuild after the market disappeared, because there was no legal foundation for the rebuild.???Last month, 21 of the site???s 79 households voluntarily allowed their homes to be demolished. The remaining households face eviction and forced demolition next month by the council, which owns the land.???We have been negotiating since 1970, but there has never been a result,??? Lu said in response to campaigners??? calls for more time for residents to find homes.While the council has no immediate use for the land, broader government policy requires that it vacate fixed percentages of illegal inhabitants on its land every year, he said, while disputing claims that residents were ???disadvantaged??? or military veterans.Only 25 of the remaining 58 buildings are inhabited by their owner, he said, adding that investigations have found that 18 are leased and 15 are uninhabited.Of the 25 inhabited by their owners, only four households meet government standards for receiving welfare and other benefits for poor or disadvantaged people, he said, adding that only 10 were inhabited by military veterans or their families.???We originally hoped to reapportion the land to allow them to remain, but the number of residences increased by 56 in 1960 to 79 today,??? said Yang Chang-cheng (?¢D???¡P???), the director of a nearby military veterans??? retirement home, on whose land the Daguan community is built.The area violates spacing standards, but residents have not agreed to demolition, he said.",2
7217,Taiwan News,"The Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee on Wednesday accused the National Women???s League of breaching tax exemption requirements for nonprofit organizations, calling it ???a possible serial tax dodger.???Citing National Tax Bureau documents, committee spokeswoman Shih Chin-fang (?????????) said the league owed the government back taxes of NT$3 million (US$99,334) for 1997, NT$516 million for 2011 and NT$40 million this year.To be tax exempt, a nonprofit must use at least 60 percent of its revenue from the interest of its fund and other sources of income for its stated purpose, according to the Rules Governing the Income Tax-exempt Status of Educational, Cultural, Public Welfare and Charitable Organizations or Institutions (??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????).Shih said the league relied on the regulation for its tax-exempt status, and exactly how it had incurred back taxes is not yet clear.The committee has found other irregularities in the league???s financial documents from 2015, when it reported NT$350 million in revenue and NT$220 million in expenditures, of which NT$30 million were pension-related expenditures.The league???s pension expenditures in 2015 were considerably higher than in previous years, which ranged from several hundred thousand New Taiwanese dollars to several million, she said.The inclusion of pension-related spending as part of ???expenditures for its stated purpose??? to meet its exemption requirement was a ???questionable??? accounting decision, Shih said.The league might owe substantial back taxes for 2015, she said.The committee also believes that the National Women???s League Foundation for the Hearing Impaired had breached exemption requirements, she said.In 2012, the Ministry of Finance ruled that the foundation was in breach of exemption requirements and demanded that it pay back taxes, Shih said.However, the Ministry of Education ??? the then-managing authority of the foundation ??? allowed the foundation to make up the shortfall in its purpose-driven expenditures over a four-year period, thereby allowing the foundation to remain tax-exempt, she said.Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen Chi-mai (?????????) accused the league of failing to spend an appropriate share of its expenditures on charity to comply with tax-exemption requirements.The league also failed to pay taxes on its interest-derived income. In 2008 the interest income was NT$850 million, he said.He added that the tax bureau found that the league failed to file its business income tax for 2011 and had later paid after filing NT$516 million in business income tax.Between 2012 and 2015, the league???s loan interest amounted to at least NT$310 million per year, which had accumulated NT$62 million in back taxes on the interest income over the four years, and it was not completely repaid until last year, Chen said.???The tax bureau in 2011 billed the league for NT$516 million in back taxes, which means that it knew about the league???s tax dodging for years,??? he said.The league was registered as a political organization in 1990 and its charter has no provisions for liquidating its assets if it is dissolved, which should have disqualified it for tax exemption, Chen said.The league has refused to change its charter and resorted to paying back taxes, proving it wants to hide assets from public oversight, he said.",2
7262,World News,"A cybersecurity researcher appears to have discovered a ???kill switch??? that can prevent the spread of the WannaCry ransomware ??? for now ??? that has caused the cyberattacks wreaking havoc globally, reports said yesterday.The researcher, tweeting as @MalwareTechBlog, said the discovery was accidental, but that registering a domain name used by the malware stops it from spreading.???Essentially they relied on a domain not being registered and by registering it, we stopped their malware spreading,??? @MalwareTechBlog told reporters in a private message on Twitter.However, the researcher warned that people ???need to update their systems??? as soon as possible to avoid attack.???The crisis isn???t over, they can always change the code and try again,??? the researcher said.Friday???s wave of cyberattacks, which affected dozens of countries, apparently exploited a flaw exposed in documents leaked from the US National Security Agency.The attacks used a technique known as ransomware that locks users??? files unless they pay the attackers a designated sum in the virtual currency bitcoin.Affected by the onslaught were computer networks at hospitals in Britain, the Russian Ministry of the Interior, Spanish telecom giant Telefonica, US delivery firm FedEx and many other organizations.???I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental,??? @MalwareTechBlog tweeted.Computers already affected will not be helped by the solution.???So long as the domain isn???t revoked, this particular strain will no longer cause harm, but patch your systems ASAP, as they will try again,??? the researcher said.The malware???s name is WCry, but analysts were also using variants such as WannaCry.Forcepoint Security Labs said in a statement on Friday that the attack had ???global scope??? and was affecting networks in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Mexico.In the US, FedEx acknowledged it had been hit by malware and was ???implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible.???Also badly hit was Britain???s National Health Service, which declared a ???major incident??? after the attack, which forced some hospitals to divert ambulances and scrap operations.Pictures posted on social media showed screens of the health service???s computers with images demanding payment of US$300 in bitcoin, saying: ???Ooops, your files have been encrypted!???",2
7294,Business,"US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross sees the US semiconductor industry as still dominant globally, but said he is worried that it will be threatened by China???s planned investment binge to build up its own chipmaking industry.Ross told reporters in an interview last week that his agency is considering a national security review of semiconductors under a 1962 trade law because of their ???huge defense implications,??? including their use in military hardware, and proliferation in devices throughout the economy.He has launched similar ???Section 232??? reviews of the US steel and aluminum sectors, where a flood of imports, especially from China, has depressed prices, threatening the industries??? long-term health.The probes could lead to broad import restrictions on the metals and the administration of US President Donald Trump could potentially take similar actions based on the findings of a semiconductor investigation.???Semiconductors are one of our shining industries, but they have gone from substantial surplus to the beginnings of a deficit,??? Ross said. ???China has a US$150 billion program to take that much further between now and 2025. That is scary.???Ross was referring to China???s plans for massive state-directed investments in semiconductor manufacturing capacity under its ???Made in China 2025??? program, which aims to replace mostly imported semiconductors with domestic products.Ross??? predecessor at the US Department of Commerce, Penny Pritzker, in November last year warned about looming market distortions if China builds too much semiconductor capacity.Ross said that while he understands Beijing???s logic in developing its domestic chip industry, ???that???s going to be a struggle??? from a US trade standpoint.Meanwhile, US semiconductor makers have other ideas about how to secure their future.Their major trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), advocates open trade and increased access to international markets, which buy 80 percent of US-made semiconductors.US chipmakers also depend on a complex global supply chain and have nearly half their production capacity located overseas.???So while we fully support efforts to ensure trade in semiconductors is fair and market-based, we do not believe a Section 232 investigation is the right tool to be applied to our industry??? SIA president John Neuffer told reporters.One area where there appear to be some differences is how to define the industry???s trade balance.Department data showed that ???semiconductors and related device manufacturing??? had a trade deficit of US$2.4 billion last year, with exports of US$43.1 billion and imports of US$45.6 billion.However, that category includes rapidly growing imports of non-semiconductor devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes as well as some raw materials.In a submission late on Wednesday to the department for a study on trade deficits, SIA said that excluding the non-semiconductor products shows the sector had a US$6.4 billion trade surplus last year, with exports of US$41.3 billion and imports of US$34.9 billion.",2
