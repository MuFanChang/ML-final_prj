"Jane lived near the sea, and she often went down to the beach to sit on the sand.  Being by the sea was like being in a different world.  In front of her was the deep blue water; it slowly moved toward her and then moved away again.  Sometimes it suddenly came very close and then her feet were covered by the salty water.  Above her, soft white clouds continually floated across the pretty blue sky.  Noisy white birds were flying over her head as well.  Sometimes they dived down suddenly to catch a fish, and then they quickly flew back up into the air.  Jane often sat by the sea for hours to enjoy this special place.",1

"The Martin family took a two-week vacation last summer.  The day before the trip, all of the family members helped with the preparations.  Mr. Martin asked the neighbors, the Smiths, to check the mailbox every day and take out any letters or advertisements.  After lunch, Mrs. Martin took all the extra food out of the refrigerator; she gave some to the Smiths, and she threw away the rest.  Paul Martin put several cans of dog food in a bag, and he took his big dog Roxy over to his friend's house.  Mary and Susie Martin cleaned the whole house.  They swept and washed the floors in all of the rooms, dusted the furniture, and cleaned the bathroom. That evening, the Martin family ate dinner at a restaurant.  When they arrived home, Mr. Martin told the family to take off their clothes and put on T-shirts and shorts.

"Harry woke up hungry last Thursday because he had eaten dinner very early the night before.  Even before getting dressed, he went into the kitchen to get something to eat.  He decided to have cereal, but when he opened the refrigerator, he found there was no milk.  Then he decided to have eggs and toast, but when he looked for the eggs, he wasn't able to find any.  He only found two pieces of bread, so he decided to just make toast while he got dressed.  However, when he came back to the kitchen, his toast was badly burned because the toaster was set on high.  He looked around for something else to eat but only found several cookies, so he ate the cookies and went to school hungry. ",1

"Because the beautiful lake country of central Canada has few roads but thousands of lakes and streams, it is best explored by canoe. All the lakes are connected to each other by trails, called portages, and most lakes have one or two camping areas to choose from. Visitors can start their journey on one lake, paddle their canoe across the lake to a portage and then carry it, along with their supplies, down the trail to the next lake. In this way, they can travel from lake to lake while they enjoy the fresh air, clean water and quiet surroundings of this beautiful area

"Large animals have relatively smaller brains than small ones. As we move from small to large creatures, from mice to elephants or small lizards to komodo dragons, brain size increases, but not as fast as body size. In other words, bodies grow faster than brains, and large animals have low ratios of brain weight to body weight. In fact, brains grow only about two-thirds as fast as bodies. Since there is no reason to believe that large animals are consistently less intelligent than their smaller relatives, it must be concluded that large animals require relatively less brain to do as well as smaller animals. If this relationship is not recognized, the mental power of very large animals, such as dinosaurs, will be underestimated.",2
"Manners are the ways in which people behave in various situations with other people. If they behave properly, we say that they have good manners, and  if they behave badly, we say that they have bad manners. However, what are good manners in one society may be bad manners in another. For example, in one society, it may be good manners for an old man to open a door for a young woman because men should be polite to women in this way; on the other hand, in another society it may be better manners for a young woman to open a door for an old man because young people should be polite to old people in this way.

"There are many smart people in the world, so how does an ordinary person achieve success? The rules are simple. First, learn self-discipline. Most of all, this involves patience, so don't expect too much too soon. Learning to handle people and get them to be the best they can be is also important. Don't look for glory for yourself, but make friends and give credit where credit is due.  Moreover, continue to learn more about your field.  Do extra research until you really know all about your subject. Likewise, develop abilities you already have, like a logical mind, or bargaining skills, so that you can use them effectively when needed. Also, keep your promises. If people can rely on you, you will earn their respect. Finally, if you fail once, don't quit. Use that opportunity to make yourself better and more determined to succeed.",2

"In public service lectures, fire fighters not only teach about fire prevention, escape plans, and the use of fire extinguishers, but also warn people never to go back into a burning building for any reason. Many people die each year from breathing smoke after rushing back into their homes to save valuables.  When people who have lost their homes in a fire are asked what items they most regret losing, most reply ""family photographs."" Baby pictures and photographs of weddings, friends, relatives and vacations are often impossible to replace. Fire fighters recommend that people make copies of their important photographs and documents and ask a friend to keep them for the family.

"Countries that produce coffee have traditionally aged their coffee beans. Today, modern shipping practices are getting coffee to market faster and faster. As a result, consumers have acquired a taste for fresher coffee and therefore fresher beans.  This has caused a major shift in coffee bean storage procedures.

Now, however, these considerations are key to the success of the coffee bean industry.",2
"The majority of public schools in the United States are co-educational; most schools teach boys and girls together in the same classes.  Some parents, however, believe that it is better for their children to be educated in single-sexed settings. Therefore, they send their children to private schools which separate boys from girls.  There is a concern among those who are opposed to co-education that the distractions of typical teenage issues, such as dating, might hold back the individual student's ability to learn. On the other hand, advocates of co-educational learning environments believe that it is better to educate our young in communities that reflect the realities of their future adulthood lives. They point out that whether students are educated in co-educational or single-sexed schools, both sexes will have to interact on a daily basis in the work place later in life",2

Tropical islands, crystal clear waters, long beaches, clean air and a delightful mix of cultures make it a great vacation destination for families. Historical sites, like Spanish forts, plantation houses, and shipwrecks, attract vacationers of all ages. Duty free shopping on some islands draws visitors looking for bargains. And on the beaches, sports like water skiing, sailing, snorkeling, and scuba diving keep vacationers busy and happy. Whether you prefer relaxation or activity, you'll enjoy a vacation in the Caribbean",2
"After several years of falling sales, Burger King is selling more food again.  Their problems began when another company from Britain bought their parent company, and British executives tried to run Burger King, a company that sells American food.  The British people at the top simply did not understand hamburgers and tried things like pizza and shrimp baskets. The higher management also failed to listen to the shop owners, who knew what was good and what was bad. Things changed in 1993. The unhappy shop owners got together to tell the management what was wrong, and since then, Burger King has returned to the basics: hamburgers, French fries, and drinks. The new president of the company, an American, also brought Burger King back by offering low-priced meals and a new hamburger that is similar to the McDonald's Big Mac.  In 1996, Burger King's share of the market grew from 18% to 19%, still far behind the competition, but the improvement has been continuous, and the British are letting Americans sell American food",2

The dozen or so guests who can be accommodated at the 150-year-old estate stay in oak-paneled rooms with 19th century furnishings and eat like kings around a long banquet table. (A big English breakfast and three- course dinner are included in the price.) During the day, you can hike  around the island on nearly empty roads, seeing more sheep and cows than people, the horizon of sea and clouds continually in view. Or take a leisurely stroll through the 700 acres of garden and woods on the estate grounds. On chilly Orkney evenings, sit in front of a roaring fireplace and read one of the 4,000 leather-bound books in the castle library. For a unique vacation experience, ferry across the North Sea to another world...at Balfour Castle. ",2

"The digital age is dawning, and that's good news for Asian companies. Already, a high percentage of the world's new digital products, such as DVD players and digital cameras, are being produced there, not only because manufacturing costs are lower there than in North America and Europe, but also because Asia has become a center for innovation. Japanese companies, of course, have long been admired for their ability to design and manufacture consumer products that incorporate the latest technology while offering the most-desired functions. Now other Asian countries like Korea and Taiwan are following its lead. With the worldwide demand for digital products growing at a furious pace, the future looks bright for the Asian companies that make them",2
"In gardens and forests around the world, there is more and more evidence that the earth's atmosphere is warming up.  In North America, many species of birds which used to fly south for the cold winter months are staying in the north instead.   A study of 77 gardens in Europe showed that flowers are blooming earlier and leaves are falling later.  In other words, as the atmosphere has gotten warmer, the growing season for vegetation has become a little bit longer each year.  On the European continent, summer is apparently eleven days longer than it was forty years ago. The 1990s were the warmest decade of the twentieth century, and the changes in air temperatures affected ocean temperatures as well.  Greenland's ice sheet has been melting rapidly, and high ocean temperatures are also damaging the coral reefs. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that global warming is either slowing down or coming to an end",2

It differs from the earlier aircraft, however, in its on-board instrumentation, which includes an advanced radar system and state-of-the-art communications equipment. In the event of a crisis, these facilities will enable the president to remain in contact with armed forces commanders while he is on board ""Air Force One."" Two teams of ROC air force pilots will receive training in the US in using the new equipment before flying the aircraft back to Taiwan from there via Hawaii and Guam",2
"This is to confirm my resignation from the position of Good Morning Taiwan Editor, effective March 31, 2000. There are several reasons for my resignation, but to put it simply, I'm just too tired. To do my job well, I need to spend at least ten hours a day at the office, which leaves me no time for anything else. In light of this, I recently accepted a job at Let's Learn English Inc., where I will be editing textbooks for children. I will be working fewer hours a day, for almost as much as I am making at Formosa News. This will permit me time to pursue other interests, including night classes at one of the local universities. Regarding the salary at Formosa News, I feel it is reasonable, and in line with the industry standard. However, I believe that the company should consider creating a position for an assistant editor, as this job is really too much for one person. Finally, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to work at Formosa News. I wish you all the very best in the future",2
"Over time, cacti literally reshaped themselves to fit their environment, by increasing their bulk and reducing the surface area they expose to the sun.  Cacti stopped bearing leaves; they could no longer afford to supply broad-surfaced appendages with water.  When the cacti dispensed with foliage, their stems and branches took over the leaves' work of manufacturing food.  By drawing energy from almost constant sunlight and moisture from their water-storing interior pulp, cacti can function all year round and flower even during lenghty droughts.  Many other adaptations help cacti survive in a harsh environment.  Their shallow, widespread root systems absorb maximum moisture in a region of brief rainstorms and thin quick-draining soil.  The waxy finish on their tough skins retards moisture loss, and their armament of sharp spines affords protection from sun, wind and from the depredations of hungry, thirsty desert creatures",2
"In any group of elderly people, it is common to see some women who are unable to stand completely upright.  Their backs and heads are bent forward slightly, as if they were carrying a heavy load.  This is usually a sign of a bone problem that has developed over a number of years, a problem called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis literally means porous bones¡Xbones that are filled with tiny holes.  Our bones are in a constant state of change, continuously broken down and rebuilt through the body's chemical processes.  Two kinds of cells are important in these processes: osteoclasts and osteoblasts.  Osteoclasts renew the old bone by dissolving or reabsorbing it; this leaves an empty space.  Osteoblasts then fill this empty space with new bone. When the rate of bone renewal doesn't equal the rate of breakdown, bone loss results.  When the bone loss becomes advanced, it is called osteoporosis.  The bones don't actually change shape with osteoporosis; rather, they become porous, and therefore are more likely to break.  Often the first sign of osteoporosis is a bone fracture following a minor fall or accident",2
"One of the largest youth organizations in the world is the 4-H, an organization of clubs for young people between 9 and 19.  The main purpose of 4-H is to provide young people with the practical skills and understanding they will need to become useful members of their communities.  The four H's stand for head, heart, hands, and health. When 4-H clubs first began in America in the early 1900s, members were mostly young people from rural areas.  The focus was on farm projects, such as raising pigs and growing and canning food.  Today over 75% of the club members come from towns, cities, and suburbs, and hundreds of projects exist, each adapted to its geographical area.  While rural districts abound in conservation, forestry, and farm management projects, projects in urban areas often involve nutrition, health, automotive care, and money management. The 4-H program in America is a joint service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, state universities, and county governments.  Additional funding is provided by business firms and private organizations.  Members of the clubs are guided by volunteer adult leaders and their teenage assistants.  In the clubs, 4-H'ers learn about and work on solving serious problems that face their communities, issues like environmental protection and community safety. In addition to the 4-H clubs in the U.S. states and territories, more than eighty countries, including Taiwan, have adapted the 4-H idea to fit their own needs.  In the less developed countries, many clubs offer courses in proper nutrition and in new farming technology",2

"In modern hospitals, the most popular treatment for bacterial infection is antibiotics.  While these medicines are generally highly effective in fighting the infection, one problem is that over a period of time bacteria begin to mutate¡Xchange their structure¡Xin order to resist the antibiotics.  Consequently as the human population consumes more antibiotics, the infection-producing bacteria become stronger and more resistant to the drugs. Another reason for the increased consumption of antibiotics is that doctors often  prescribe them to patients too freely.  Both doctors and patients prefer treatment providing fast relief, rather than allowing the body to battle the infection by itself. But unnecessary prescriptions are not the only source of antibiotics.  They have been increasingly used on farms, where chickens and pigs are frequently fed antibiotics to combat disease.  The result is that when the general public eats the meat products, they consume the animals'  antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well",2

"Over time, cacti literally reshaped themselves to fit their environment, by increasing their bulk and reducing the surface area they expose to the sun.  Cacti stopped bearing leaves; they could no longer afford to supply broad-surfaced appendages with water.  When the cacti dispensed with foliage, their stems and branches took over the leaves' work of manufacturing food.  By drawing energy from almost constant sunlight and moisture from their water-storing interior pulp, cacti can function all year round and flower even during lenghty droughts.  Many other adaptations help cacti survive in a harsh environment.  Their shallow, widespread root systems absorb maximum moisture in a region of brief rainstorms and thin quick-draining soil.  The waxy finish on their tough skins retards moisture loss, and their armament of sharp spines affords protection from sun, wind and from the depredations of hungry, thirsty desert creatures",2
"For thousands of years, Chinese artists have used a material called lacquer to prevent the surfaces of objects made of wood or other materials from being damaged.  Many beautiful lacquer pieces can be found today in collections of Chinese art. The process of producing a lacquer piece, however, is both difficult and long.  To begin with, the original object must be made, perhaps a wooden bowl or vase with a design carved in its surface.  Meanwhile, farmers collect raw, liquid lacquer from lacquer trees, each of which can produce only a small amount.  After enough lacquer has been collected, a lacquer artist must then clean it by passing it through cloth and also beat it in order to remove excess water.  The original color of the lacquer is not attractive so the artist next adds some other material to change the color to red or black.  Now, the artist can put the first of many layers of lacquer onto the surface of the object.  After the first layer is dry, he must polish it and then apply the next layer.  When the last layer has been applied, the object will not only be beautiful, but also safeguarded against damage",2
"One animal which has become extinct was once probably the most numerous bird in North America:  the passenger pigeon.  The passenger pigeon bred in the eastern part of the U.S. and Canada and often migrated to the southern U.S. during the winter months.  The bird's name came not from the migrations but from its highly visible movements in search of food.  The passenger pigeons were social birds, traveling in amazingly large numbers that ranged from the millions to one or two billion.  Passing overhead on a broad front, a flock of birds could darken the sky as effectively as storm clouds for a period of hours. Passenger pigeons bred in huge colonies, and these colonies frequently covered many square miles.  A hundred or more pairs of pigeons often nested in the same tree, each female laying a single egg.  The birds lived mainly on wild seeds and nuts, but sometimes a flock would swoop down onto a field or a garden and eat everything in sight. While vast numbers of passenger pigeons were recorded in the late nineteenth century, the population declined rapidly, and the last wild bird was shot in 1904.  The swift disappearance of the bird remains a mystery, but a partial explanation is found in its habit of nesting and moving in a large flock.  Farmers, who considered them pests, found it easy to catch hundreds at a time in nets.  Also, as passenger pigeons were tasty game birds, market hunters shot hundreds of thousands on their nesting grounds.  By 1900 the passenger pigeon was already rare.",2
"Scientists from Stanford, Princeton, and U.C. Berkeley said in a recent report that vertebrates (animals with spinal cords) are becoming extinct at a rate not seen since the dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago in the 5th mass extinction. While the past five extinction events likely followed violent natural disasters, the current collapse in biodiversity is linked to human actions that have led to deforestation, pollution, global warming, and habitat loss. Animal species are currently disappearing at a rate 114 times faster than normal, which is more gradual pace than how the dinosaurs met their end. But Gerardo Ceballos, the report¡¦s lead author, warned that humans may actually be one of the earlier casualties this time around. With the destruction of fragile ecosystems, for example, pollinating bees could meet their demise in less than three human generations. Though not vertebrates, bees play a crucial role in our food supply. By some estimates, bees are responsible for pollinating over 400 different types of agricultural plants, and according to OneGreenPlanet.org, help produce US$19 billion worth of crops, or a third of what Americans eat each year.",2
"The most senior female executive of the world¡¦s largest automaker was arrested in Japan on June 18 for illegally importing the powerful painkiller oxycodone into the country. Toyota Motor President Akio Toyoda, grandson of the car company¡¦s founder Kiichiro Toyoda, was quick to defend Julie Hamp, saying the firm¡¦s global head of public relations ¡§had no intention to violate the law¡¨ when she had 57 tablets sent from Kentucky to a Tokyo hotel where she was staying. Indeed, oxycodone is legal with a doctor¡¦s prescription in both the U.S. and Japan. It is also legal to bring oxycodone into Japan with prior authorization, which Ms. Hamp did not obtain. Instead, the pills were sent in a package labeled ¡§necklaces.¡¨ The American executive was promoted in April as part of Toyoda¡¦s drive to increase diversity among its predominately male, Japanese executive ranks. It is unknown whether Ms. Hamp had legitimate medical reasons for the painkiller. It is also unknown if Ms. Hamp understood Japanese law regarding the transport of regulated medicine. It is clear, however, that an executive whose job description is to improve corporate image has actually succeeded in tarnishing it. The New York Times quoted a Japanese Ministry of Health official saying oxycodone ¡§is a narcotic, not a medicine.¡¨ As for Toyoda¡¦s diversity push, a Japanese reporter questioned whether promoting foreigners was wise considering the ¡§special risks¡¨ involved.
Adding insult to injury, Ms. Hamp has yet to be formally charged with a crime, and per Japanese proceedings, will likely remain in custody for weeks as formal charges are deliberated. If convicted, she could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years.

"In what is hailed as a landmark decision, the United States Supreme Court on June 26, 2015 ruled that individual states may not ban same-sex marriage, giving gay couples ¡§equal dignity in the eyes of the law,¡¨ wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy on behalf of the majority opinion in the five to four decision. US President Barack Obama said the ¡§ruling is a victory for America¡¨ because ¡§when all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.¡¨ The four justices who dissented argued not against gay rights but rather the Supreme Court acting as a legislature. In his dissenting opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the Supreme Court has ¡§power to say what the law is, not what it should be.¡¨ The United States is the 21st country in the world to legalize gay marriage nationwide. In the year 2000, the Netherlands became the first country to do so. Still, many countries consider homosexuality a crime. Being gay in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death while in Malaysia the punishment is up to 20 years in prison. In response to the US ruling, ROC Deputy Minister of Justice Chen Ming-Tang said ¡§the issue of legalizing same-sex marriage remains extremely controversial"" in Taiwan and will not be considered ¡§for now.¡¨ DPP presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen echoed the sentiment, saying it took a long time and a lot of dialogue before the U.S. Supreme Court made the ruling and that there should be rational dialogue in Taiwan to narrow the differences on the issue.",2
"The Taiwan subsidiary of the U.S.-owned McDonald's Corporation has confirmed that the company is currently seeking to change its management and operational strategy in the country, but will not be withdrawing from the Taiwan market. The company said that on June 12, a letter written by its Asia president was published in English on McDonald's employees' communications forum ""Town Hall"" to notify workers that the firm would be removing its managing subsidiary from Taiwan, and will instead seek to implement the ""developmental licensee"" market strategy. According to an official McDonald's press release, the decision was made in response to the company's international revitalization plan. The company said that it is constantly seeking to improve itself, and has opted to adopt the new strategy following evidence that it would be most beneficial to both local customers and the international chains alike. McDonald's also said the developmental licensee strategy is a plan that the company is very familiar with, as it has been used in around 70 other markets for the last 30 years. The company said that it is currently seeking prospective investment partners to take up the offer and become licensees. Such investors must display excellent management skills and knowledge of both the Taiwanese market and McDonald's own brand, the official said. Following the plan, local management of the company would fall to a Taiwanese firm. The value of the entire transaction has been estimated at more than NT$10 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported on June 26th that McDonald¡¦s adopts the licensee and franchisee model in more mature markets and has been doing so in the US as well. It is its current strategy to eliminate extraneous cost and management layers. Mcdonald¡¦s new chief executive Steven Easterbrook said that they will continue to grow this model from its current 81% to 90% of its business and is looking to sell 3,500 of their restaurants to franchisees by 2018. For Taiwan, that would translate to 413 stores and well over 16,000 staff. The licensee model may well improve sales in Taiwan. In Thailand, which operates under a similar model, McDonald¡¦s is known for its culture and locally developed menu has become a tourist destination. The Thai operator is doing so well it is on track to double the number of restaurants from 100 to 200 by 2020.",2
"Taiwan commemorated the 70th anniversary of the R.O.C.'s victory over Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War on July 4th by holding a large-scale public military display in Hsinchu featuring the R.O.C.'s recently acquired military aircraft and locally developed weapons. President Ma said observing the eight-year war celebration ""is not about boasting about victory but about preventing war. It is not about provoking hatred against another country but is about seeking peace."" In response to complaints from the Japanese envoy in Taipei, the ROC Ministry of Defense removed the Rising Sun flag emblems from two U.S.-made Curtis P-40 aircraft prior to being displayed on Saturday¡¦s parade. The fighter planes were flown by the American Volunteer Group (AVG) against Japanese aggression, better known as the Flying Tigers, and the emblems represented Japanese aircraft shot down during the conflict. Also present were 134 veterans who participated in the war, which claimed the
lives of more than 3 million KMT soldiers. Hsu Ming-te , a former navy officer during the conflict, said attending the military display felt like going back in time to the war years. He reflected in sadness that""it would have been better if this event were held 20 years ago"" so that more surviving R.O.C. veterans could have attended. President Ma played down the Communist¡¦s role in fighting side by side with KMT forces in the war that began on July 7, 1937. According to the Associated Press, Ma said the ""resistance was led by the Republic of China and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was the force behind it¡Kno one is allowed to distort that."" Saturday¡¦s event was likely a response to mainland China¡¦s upcoming military parade in September to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. The PRC has invited the leaders of major countries involved in the war to attend.

"Since Mark Zuckerberg launched a little known website on February 4, 2004 called ¡§The Facebook,¡¨ the world¡¦s largest social media site has amassed 1.4 billion active users as of the end of the 1st quarter of 2015. So what¡¦s next? With China openly hostile to Facebook (the company dropped the ¡§the¡¨ from its name after buying the domain facebook.com for 200,000 US dollars in 2005), Africa has become Zuckerberg¡¦s newest target for growth. Of the continent¡¦s 1.1 billion inhabitants, Facebook claims just slightly over 20 million as users as of September 2014. By the end of 2015 the company expects that number to swell to 120 million. Facebook recently hired the ex-head of advertising agency Ogilvy in South Africa, Nunu Ntshingila, to set up its first African office in Johannesburg. The initial hire of 25 employees is modest considering the company¡¦s target of one billion African users in the near future. With more than 80% of African Facebook users accessing the social network via mobile devices, Facebook has been pushing a zero-rate plan for those who can¡¦t afford wireless data plans. In conjunction with Facebook¡¦s Internet.org initiative to help connect the world¡¦s 4 billion people who still don¡¦t have access to the Internet, the zero-rate program partners with mobile operators to allow users access to selected sites, such as Wikipedia, Google and Facebook, for free. ""Mobile is not a trend; it¡¦s the fastest development in communications we¡¦ve ever seen. This couldn¡¦t be truer in Africa ¡V where so many people are mobile-only,"" Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in the statement. ""Facebook is already a central part of people¡¦s lives in Africa and¡Kwe want to do more to help people and businesses connect."" The effort to bring connectivity to the
masses is not without its detractors. Just May of this year, a local African digital library group accused Internet.org of creating a ¡§two-tiered¡¨ Internet by restricting access to just a few sites. Several Indian companies have pulled their support for the project. The Chilean government has banned it outright, saying zero-rate plans violate net neutrality ideals, the idea that Internet service providers must allow access to all websites. Undeterred, Facebook is developing new technology that may sidestep mobile carriers altogether. Facebook recently revealed that it is testing lasers as a medium to deliver the Internet. The idea is to beam lasers from drones and satellites, which according to Zuckerberg will ¡§dramatically increase the speed of sending data over long distances.¡¨

"PChome Online Inc., the largest business-to-consumer e-commerce service provider in Taiwan, sold 9 million packs of tissue paper through its 24-hour online store in the first five months of the year, representing growth of over 20 percent year on year, the company said Wednesday. Calculated based on the height of a packet of tissue paper measuring 20 centimeters, tissues sold through PChome in the five-month period could be piled into 3,535 Taipei 101 skyscrapers, according to the company. Tissue paper and diapers were among the top 10 best-selling daily supplies at the PChome 24h online store, which now sells more than 36,000 various daily supplies. The number of items grew by 30 percent from the same period of last year, and the revenues generated by such sales have risen 40 percent year on year, according to the report.
PChome Store Vice General Manager Tsai Kai-wen said in the company's analysis of online shopping practices in the first five months of the year that they found sales of diapers grew 1.5 times compared with the year-earlier period. The rise was attributed to the rising birthrate in 2012, which was the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese calendar, a year considered to be auspicious in Taiwanese society. Also recording significant growth was sales of medical supplements such as gauze masks, body fat measurement scales and heating pads, Tsai said. The online sales of medical supplements from January to May grew three times compared with the same period of last year, Tsai noted. He also said that repeat customers reached 30 percent, many of whom reside in southern and central areas of the country. According to the PChome survey, nearly 75 percent of online orders for daily supplies were from shoppers living northern areas, mostly in Taipei and New Taipei.

"Indonesian police posing as wildlife buyers have arrested a suspected trafficker for selling protected eagles on Facebook, an official said Wednesday. Acting on a tip-off, authorities in Indonesia's second-largest city of Surabaya swooped on the man's home on Monday, where they discovered 14 eagles in cages and cardboard boxes, provincial police force spokesman Argo Yuwono told AFP. Among the various species were white-bellied sea eagles and spotted kestrels, as well as five baby eaglets, Yuwono said. ""Before arresting him, we went undercover and acted as buyers to confirm he was selling the birds on Facebook,"" he said. ""Eagles are protected animals in Indonesia. Selling these birds is illegal and a serious crime."" It's the first known case in Indonesia of wildlife being sold through the popular social networking site, the spokesman said. Police claim the man had been running his online operation for six months, selling eaglets for 750,000 rupiah (US$56) and fully grown birds for up to five million rupiah each. Yuwono said four of the eaglets had since died from illness, but the other birds had been sent to Indonesia's natural resources conservation office, which deals with wildlife-trafficking cases. If found guilty of possessing and selling the protected animals, the trafficker could face five years prison and 100 million rupiah in fines. Indonesian police in May arrested a suspected wildlife smuggler after discovering nearly two dozen live birds, mostly yellow-crested cockatoos, jammed alive inside plastic water bottles in his luggage.",2
"Former Nazi SS officer Oskar Groening, known as the Bookkeeper of Auschwitz, was sentenced earlier this month to four years in prison on 300,000 counts of being an accessory to murder during World War II. The three-months trial revealed many horrific stories from Auschwitz, Nazi¡¦s most infamous death camp, but most of the victims who took the stand claimed that they do not remember seeing Groening at the camp. The court nonetheless found the 94 year-old guilty for his essential role at the concentration camp. During the trial, Groening admitted to his service at the camp and expressed guilt for his crimes, but denied any direct involvement in the killings. Judge Franz Kompisch ruled that Groening was ¡§legally connected¡¨ to 300,000 cases of Hungarian Jews sent to gas chambers from May to July of 1944. Judge Kompisch went on to say that Groening had voluntarily taken up a ¡§safe desk job¡¨ designed purely for killing prisoners, a system that was ¡§inhumane and all but unbearable for the human psyche.¡¨ His main responsibility in Auschwitz was to sort and count the money taken from the prisoners and then deposit it at the Nazi base camp in Berlin. The court proceedings convened almost
daily between April and June. Each session lasted three hours, after which Groening was taken back to the hospital. Due to his physical ailments, Groening had to be carried in and out of the courtroom. Groening¡¦s lawyers have announced that they fully intend to appeal the decision, hoping that Groening would never have to go behind bars. President of the European Jewish Congress Dr. Moshe Kantor said that he welcomed the ¡§verdict and the historic significance of the trial of Oskar Groening, and the opportunity it provides for educating a generation that is all too distant from the horrors of the Holocaust.¡¨ ¡§Although more than 70 years have passed since the liberation of the Nazi death camps,¡¨ Kantor continued, ¡§this trial reminds us that there is no statute of limitations for those responsible for Nazi horrors and of the real and present danger of intolerance and demonstrates the constant need to guard against anti-Semitism, racism and hate.¡¨ Among the co-plaintiffs were more than a dozen Holocaust survivors and relatives, who welcomed the verdict, calling it a ¡§very late step toward justice.¡¨ As the proceedings concluded with the defense calling for an acquittal, Groening seized a last opportunity to address the judge. Begging for mercy, he stated he was ¡§very sorry¡¨ for his time stationed at the Nazi death camp, adding that ¡§No one should have taken part in Auschwitz.¡¨ Groening testified that the crimes he witnessed at the camp were so horrific that he asked three times to be transferred before he was finally moved to the front battle lines in October 1944. In earlier interviews, Groening said he witnessed SS officers toying with a baby left at a station platform, ultimately kicking the baby to death. He said that he was only there to watch over the valuables confiscated and did not take part in the decision of who to send into the gas chambers. Prosecutors argued that by doing this, Groening helped maintain order at the camp, and thus created a smoother operation at Auschwitz. Defense attorneys Hans Holtermann argued that there was no proof that Groening ¡§aided and abetted a crime.¡¨ ¡§Mr. Groening was never an accessory to the Holocaust,¡¨ Hotlermann said, ¡§neither with his presence at the camp nor by transferring and counting money nor with any other actions, at least not in any legal sense.¡¨ The defense team pled for clemency on grounds of Groening¡¦s poor health and his willingness to testify in detail regarding the atrocities committed at Auschwitz, something many defendants of Holocaust war crimes had refused to do. In the 1970s, after extensive criminal probes, German authorities had cleared Groening of criminal wrongdoing during his time at the concentration camp. This changed in 2011 when the trial of concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk reopened the legal foundation for prosecuting ex-Nazis. Demjanjuk was convicted solely on the reason of having worked at the Sobibor camp in Poland. Kurt Schrimm, a leading prosecutor of Nazi era criminals, said that cases against Nazi participants will continue. Between 1940 and 1945, an approximate 1.1 million European Jews died in the Auschwitz camp before it was liberated by the Soviet army.

In preparation for her upcoming China tour in November, Taylor Swift¡¦s management company will begin selling official merchandise on Jing Dong (JD.com) on August 8th. The online shop features her signature red pouty lips counting down the hours, minutes and seconds to the opening day. Named after Taylor Swift¡¦s initials and year of birth, the tour, however, may be headed for choppy waters.

"In early July, voters in North Korea, officially called Democratic People¡¦s Republic of Korea, headed to the polls to vote for their representatives on the local city level and the national People¡¦s Assemblies. Unique to North Korea was the lack of choice. The ballot consisted of the candidates that Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un had previously selected, and all the voter could do was show up and hand in an unmarked ticket. One of the purposes of the exercise was to demonstrate the citizens¡¦ support for their leader¡¦s choice. Elections also serve as a census to keep track of the citizens¡¦ whereabouts. Almost 100% of voters showed up to voice their support because North Koreans over the age of 17 are required by law to vote. Former North Korean banking official Kim Kwang-Jin, who defected to Seoul in 2003, explained that to not show up was ¡§regarded as a political offence, so it was taken more seriously than economic crimes. It meant that politically, someone was against the regime.¡¨ The North Korean election day is a public holiday and after the voting process local residential communities will hold dances to demonstrate how happy they are to exercise their democratic rights. Participation is required. Elected officials serve four-year terms but wield limited power. Representatives rarely meet to discuss policy.

Still, international observers monitor these elections for patterns that may reveal changes in Kim Jong Un¡¦s policies.

"Britain performed an about-face last Friday and granted a six-month visa to dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, apologizing for rejecting his application over an alleged criminal conviction. On July 30, Ai, through his social media account Instagram, disclosed that the British embassy in Beijing had turned down his request for a business visa saying he had failed to reveal a criminal conviction. Instead it gave him a visa covering 20 days in September when a major exhibition of Ai's work will open at London's Royal Academy. Those dates meant Ai's visa would have run out by the time Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to pays a state visit to Britain in October. Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch, saw a political motive in the visa spat. She said the British government had shown ""extreme deference"" to a Chinese government ""notorious for persecuting people for their peacefully expressed political views."" Ai, who often uses his work to draw attention to corruption and injustices in Chinese society, was jailed for almost three months in 2011 amid a wider crackdown on dissent in China. Soon after his release, tax authorities accused Ai's design company of tax evasion and ordered it to pay US$2.4 million. Ai's lawyer said that was an administrative case, not a criminal one. The artist and his supporters called the penalty official retaliation against his activism. Britain's Home Office said Friday that Home Secretary Theresa May had looked into the case and told officials to grant the six-month visa. The ministry said it had written to Ai ""apologizing for the inconvenience caused."" After his release from prison in 2011 Ai was placed under a travel ban that was only fully lifted when his passport was returned last week. On July 30 he flew to Germany, where members of his family live.

"The San Francisco city government is giving people who urinate in public a taste of their own medicine by coating building walls with paint that causes urine to bounce back onto the perpetrator. The paint, called Ultra-Ever Dry and sold by Ultratech International, contains super-hydrophobic properties and already protects the night club district in Hamburg, Germany against beer drinkers. Urine will splash a bit on traditional walls, but Ultra-Ever provides an extra kick to the splash-back effect. San Francisco Public Works Department spokeswoman Rachel Gordon said ¡§the urine will bounce back on the guy¡¦s pants and shoes.

"Sometimes being friendly and flashing a big smile is just not enough The Canadian talking and tweeting hitchhiking robot met its untimely end on August 1 in Philadelphia, where it was vandalized beyond repair and left on the side of a street. HitchBOT was on a hitchhiking, social experiment adventure in the U.S. after trekking across Canada and parts of Europe without incident last year. Strangers helped the immobile HitchBOT travel from place to place while checking items off its bucket list. The solar panel-powered robot was designed to traverse continents on the kindness of strangers and could toss out factoids and carry on limited conversation. It was equipped with a GPS tracker and a camera to chronicle its journey and was programmed to snap a photo of what was going on around it every 20 minutes. The child-sized droid started its U.S. journey on a road in Massachusetts on July 17, its rubber-gloved thumb raised skyward, a strip of tape across its body reading ¡§San Francisco or bust!¡¨ During its short-lived U.S. trip, the HitchBOT attended a Red Sox game ¡X even donning a jersey over its cylindrical torso ¡X and took a ride on the New York City subway. Co-creators Frauke Zeller and David Smith said the HitchBOT even had some good times in Philadelphia, attending an extended family picnic at a park and being taken in by a well-known You Tube user who set the robot up for its next ride. But it was then that the innocent HitchBOT met its demise. The creators were sent a photo of the vandalized robot collapsed among trash and dead leaves on the pavement in Philadelphia, its pool noodle arms ripped from its torso, its plastic cake saver skull and robot brain nowhere in sight. They decided not to share that image because it could be upsetting to some viewers. To some crime experts, the tale of HitchBOT is a parable about American violence. Jeff Ferrell, a professor of sociology at Texas Christian University, wasn¡¦t surprised by the robot¡¦s demise. ¡§Culturally, there¡¦s sort of a meanness in the American soul that isn¡¦t present in Canada and other places, so in some ways I found it too typical,¡¨ Ferrell said. Researchers struggle to define what explains the differences between countries. Factors blamed for violence are present in both the U.S. and Canada, but the U.S. has a higher rate of violent crime, experts said. ¡§There¡¦s certainly a different kind of culture in parts of the United States, and violence is kind of an expression of that culture, which you don¡¦t find in Canada,¡¨ said Richard R. Bennett, professor of justice at American University. Zeller said many people have reached out with offers to rebuild the droid, and her team will make a decision on whether to bring the robot back to life in the coming days.

The creators don¡¦t know who destroyed the HitchBOT and are not interested in investigating the incident or pressing charges. For now, they are focusing on the question, ¡§What can be learned from this?¡¨ ¡§We¡¦ve always asked, in the context of this project: ¡¥Can robots trust humans?'¡¨ Smith said. ¡§We would say at this point, mostly.¡¨",2
"On Aug 14th, huge, fiery blasts at a warehouse for hazardous chemicals killed at least 50 people and turned nearby buildings into skeletal shells in the mainland Chinese port of Tianjin, raising questions about whether the materials had been properly stored. Hundreds of people were injured in the explosions shortly before midnight, which sent out massive fireballs that turned the night sky into day and shattered windows several kilometers away. Twelve of the dead were from among the more than 1,000 firefighters sent to the mostly industrial zone to fight the ensuing blaze. ""I thought it was an earthquake, so I rushed downstairs without my shoes on,"" said Tianjin resident Zhang Siyu, whose home is several kilometers from the blast site. ""Only once I was outside did I realize it was an explosion. There was the huge fireball in the sky with thick clouds. Everybody could see it."" Zhang said she could see wounded people weeping. She said she did not see anyone who had been killed, but ""I could feel death."" The municipal government in Tianjin, a key port and petrochemical processing hub about 120 kilometers east of Beijing, said 701 people were injured, including 71 in serious condition. It gave no figure for the missing. There was no indication of what caused the blasts, and no immediate sign of any toxic cloud in the air as firefighters brought the fire largely under control by morning. However, the Tianjin government suspended further firefighting to allow a team of chemical experts to survey hazardous materials at the site, assess dangers to the environment and decide how best to proceed.
Mainland Chinese state media said senior management of the company had been detained, and that leader Xi Jinping demanded severe punishment for anyone found responsible for the explosions. ""It was like what we were told a nuclear bomb would be like,"" said truck driver Zhao Zhencheng, who spent the night in the cab of his truck after the blasts. ""I've never even thought I'd see such a thing. It was terrifying, but also beautiful."" In a sign of sensitivity over the hazardous materials stored at the warehouse, state broadcaster CCTV went into a live broadcast of a news conference in Tianjin when the head of the municipality's Environmental Protection Bureau chief, Wen Wurui, was speaking. He said there had been no apparent impact on air monitoring stations, but that water samples were still being examined. However, when a reporter asked him whether the chemicals at the warehouse had been stored far enough away from residences in the area and Wen seemed at a loss for a response, the broadcaster suddenly cut away from the news conference, only to return to it again later.
Authorities said the blasts started at shipping containers at the warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics, a company that says it stores hazardous materials including flammable petrochemicals, sodium cyanide and toluene diisocyanate.
The initial blast apparently triggered an even bigger one. Mainland China's National Earthquake Bureau said the first blast was the equivalent of 3 tons of TNT, and the second 21 tons. The enormous fireballs from the blasts rolled through a nearby parking lot, turning a fleet of 1,000 new cars into scorched metal husks. As is customary during disasters, mainland Chinese authorities tried to keep a tight control over information. Police kept journalists and bystanders away with a cordon about 1 or 2 kilometers (about a mile) from the site. On China's popular microblogging platform of Weibo, some users complained that their posts about the blasts were deleted, and the number of searchable posts on the disaster fluctuated, in a sign that authorities were manipulating or placing limits on the number of posts. The Tianjin government said that because of the blasts it had suspended online access to public corporate records. These records might be used to trace the ownership of Ruihai. It was not clear whether the blackout was due to technical damage related to the explosion. No one answered the phone at the Tianjin Market and Quality Supervision Administration or the Tianjin Administration for Industry and
Commerce on the next day. Ruihai Logistics said on its website ¡X before it was shut down ¡X that it was established in 2011 and is an approved company for handling hazardous materials. It said it handles 1 million tons of cargo annually.

"Diver William Bartlett had just started exploring a 300-year-old shipwreck with a metal detector late last month in the waters off Florida's Atlantic Coast when he found his first Spanish gold coin. Then one coin became two and two became so many he had to stuff them into his diving glove. When he resurfaced, ""every fingertip was stacked with gold coins, and we knew then we were into something super special,"" said the captain of his boat, Jonah Martinez. Over the next two days, Martinez, Bartlett and another treasure hunter, Dan Beckingham, found 350 coins worth $4.5 million, the most valuable find from the 1715 shipwreck site in recent decades. Eleven treasure-laden ships that made up the 1715 Fleet were heading to Spain from Havana on July 31, 1715, when they encountered a hurricane off Florida's central coast. The winds and waves smashed the ships onto reefs, claiming as many as 1,000 lives in one of colonial Spain's biggest maritime disasters off Florida. Now it's turning out to be a treasure trove. In June, a family of treasurer hunters found $1 million in gold coins in an area south of the latest discovery. The latest group of treasure hunters to find millions of dollars in gold coins from the 1715 Fleet shipwrecks said they believe ""magic"" has played a role in the discoveries this summer, coming on the 300th anniversary of the sinking of Spanish colonial galleons. ""We all enjoy doing this and we all know the odds are that we will find nothing,"" Martinez said. ""To be able to go and do that, and then succeed in something like that, is more than any treasure."" They expect more discoveries to come, with $400 million in coins still undiscovered in a coastal area stretching from Melbourne to Fort Pierce, known as Florida's Treasure Coast. ""Five years ago, before I got into this business, I would have told you that magic is in fairy tales,"" said Brent Brisben, whose salvage company, Queens Jewels, owns rights to the 1715 Fleet shipwreck site. ""I truly now believe that there is an energy that pervades these shipwrecks, that I can't quantify. I truly believe that these shipwrecks wanted their story to continue, that this magically happened on this anniversary because this story still needs to be told and it's currently unfolding."" Anywhere from a dozen to two dozen subcontractors sign up with Brisben's company to search the shipwreck site each summer. The subcontractors are responsible for their boats, crew and other expenses which can tally up to $50,000 each summer. Brisben's company purchased the salvage rights to the shipwreck five years ago from the family of treasure hunter Mel Fisher, who won a lengthy court battle in the 1980s for the rights to the shipwrecks. During the legal battle, the Spanish government never asserted an interest on the lost treasure and so it has no claim on it. The state of Florida did assert a claim, and it's entitled to 20 percent of found artifacts for display in a museum in Tallahassee. The remaining discoveries are split between Brisben's company and whoever finds the treasure after a federal judge in Miami signs off on it For any treasure found washed up on land, ""it's finders, keepers,"" Brisben said.",2
"Egypt's Antiquities Ministry announced that it is inviting an Egyptologist behind a theory that the tomb of Queen Nefertiti may be located behind King Tutankhamun's 3,300-year-old tomb in the famed Valley of the Kings. British-educated expert Nicholas Reeves has been invited to Cairo in September to debate his theory with Egyptian colleagues. The theory by Reeves, while gaining a lot of attention online recently, has yet to be reviewed by peers. However, it could offer a compelling new theory into a turbulent period of ancient Egyptian history that fascinates both experts and hobbyists around the world.
The ministry said Reeves will have the opportunity to discuss his theory with Egyptian experts in September. A joint expedition to Luxor, where the King Tut's tomb is located, could be on the agenda, the ministry said. Reeves argues that Tut, who died at the age of 19, may have been rushed into an outer chamber of what was originally the tomb of Nefertiti, which has never been found. He claims high-resolution images of King Tut's tomb include lines underneath
plastered surfaces of painted walls, showing there could be two unexplored doorways, one of which leading potentially to Nefertiti's tomb. He also argues that the design of King Tut's tomb suggests it was built for a queen, rather than a king. Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, is skeptical of parts of Reeves' theory. ""The possibility that there are hidden chambers behind those walls is a reasonable suggestion, but it's the jump to Nefertiti (being) behind the door that I would find somehow problematic,"" Dodson said. ""There's absolutely no example of anyone ever doing that to a tomb."" John Darnell, a professor of Egyptology at Yale University, also said it would be ""nicely surprising"" if Nefertiti's tomb lay in a hidden passage behind Tut's tomb. British archeologist Howard Carter discovered Tut's tomb in the Valley of the Kings in 1922 and was ""meticulous"" in documenting what he found, Darnell said. ""I would be very surprised if Carter missed an additional chamber, but again, you always have to question what you think you know; and it's a very intriguing possibility,"" Darnell said, adding that he supported Reeves' research efforts. Already, there's a mummy at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo that has strong DNA evidence of being Tut's mother. DNA testing
also has provided strong evidence suggesting that Tut's father likely was the Pharaoh Akhenaten, the first pharaoh to try switching Egypt to monotheism. The testing also brought a new discovery: that Tut's mother was Akhenaten's sister. Still, some archaeologists like Dodson believe the two were probably cousins and that this DNA result could be the product of three generations of marriages between first cousins ¡X and that Nefertiti, Akhenaten's chief wife, may in fact have been Tut's mother. Many Egyptologists believe there were probably one or two co-pharaohs between Akhenaten and Tutankhamun. Many believe at least one of them may have been Nefertiti. And by finding her tomb, that could provide further insight into a period still largely obscured despite so much interest worldwide in ancient Egypt.

"The Southern Nevada Water Authority this week launched a campaign on television, radio, print and social media themed: ""There's Nothing Sexier Than Saving Water."" The ads were developed by R&R Partners, the firm behind Vegas' most famous tagline: ""What Happens Here, Stays Here."" The new advertisements depict people adjusting watering clocks as members of the opposite sex ogle with lust. It coincides with the new fall restrictions, which through Oct. 31 limits watering to three days a week and prohibits sprinklers during the day and misting systems at businesses. In June, San Francisco officials also unveiled sexy ads, which urged residents to go ""full-frontal"" and take short, steamy showers. Spokesman Scott Huntley said the new Las Vegas campaign was developed over the last year and that Nevada officials were not aware of San Francisco's recent ads. He said the Nevada water agency has for years done two-week long ""compliance"" promotions during the seasonal transitions, using humorous messages to remind users to be complaint. Violators are first given warnings before fines start at $100, exceeding $1,000 for repeat offenders.
The advertising, which cost about $1.6 million annually, is a part of the longstanding effort to plug water conservation in the desert area that has been in drought for years. ""We were the first to the game on this. We've had a tremendous amount of success that's being emulated in other places,"" Huntley said. The previous ""Don't Make Us Ask You Again"" theme was used for eight years in Vegas and featured male-centric slapstick humor because research showed that the typical household water controller was, according to Huntley, a man in his late 20s to 50s. And perhaps as proof that sex sells to everyone, Huntley said the new ads were made to also target expanding demographics, including those who are older and more diverse and female. ""There are certainly things that grab people's attention and humor does it a lot and one of the primary aspects of humor is the sexy humor ¡X that's one of the basics,"" Huntley said.",2
"A controversial new proposal to take Hong Kong's beloved trams off the streets has sparked a wave of anger from residents who fear losing track of the city's past. Known as ""ding-dings"" for the sound of their bells, trams have served the northern coastline of the city's main island for more than 110 years and still carry around 200,000 passengers a day. As development changes the face of the city, sweeping away many of its historic landmarks, trams have survived in the face of growing competition from buses and the modern MTR metro system.
But a recent proposal to scrap part of the network has renewed fears that this unique piece of heritage is also under threat. Thousands signed petitions against the suggestion that the tram service should be removed from the main financial district of Central. The proposal was put forward to the government's official town planning body by consultant Sit Kwok-keung, a former planner, who argues that it is too slow, blocks traffic and is unnecessary as the MTR expands. The retired civil servant said putting the idea forward for debate is his ""right and responsibility"". ""The tramway takes up a significant portion
of the road. Its efficiency is rather low... I am trying to make Hong Kong transportation more efficient,"" he said. The planning body will discuss the proposal in October, but the Hong Kong government has sought to reassure the traveling public by saying it had no plans to remove the trams. With 163 cars, Hong Kong's tram network is the world's largest fleet of double-deck tramcars still in operation, charging a flat rate of just HK$2.30 (30 US cents) for adults to ride the 120-stop system. Many residents of the city of seven million are increasingly focused on preserving its past, as economic development takes a toll on Hong Kong's transport heritage.",2
"The architects of the European Union set out decades ago to create an alliance free of national obstacles to the movement of people and the products of their labor. No customs checks or passport control would be necessary when crossing the internal borders. The absence of tariffs on goods or barriers to employment was supposed to foster competition, efficiency and innovation. The economic powerhouse that was supposed to arise was expected to share the wealth with the less fortunate, viewing the plight of refugees and asylum-seekers as its moral obligation to alleviate. But the blueprint for a borderless Europe emerged 30 years ago, before mass-scale terrorism became an ever-present danger and civil wars in Africa and the Middle East spurred migration of historic proportions. On a continent now guided more by security concerns than altruism, the viability of open borders is being questioned by leaders and citizens alike. And the disparate attitudes toward migrants among the 28 states in the EU is inflicting social discord and shaking faith in some of its fundamental commitments. Here is a look at the causes of Europe's
migration crisis, the patchwork of rules and practices for granting asylum and the alliance frictions resulting from this summer's historic tide of desperation: Q: Why has the volume of refugees risen so dramatically in the past few years? A: The number fleeing war and persecution hasn't been greater since World War II, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees reported at the end of 2014. More than 60 million people have been displaced by conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Ukraine and elsewhere, and the violence is expected to drive hundreds of thousands more to seek asylum this year and next. Refugees from the civil war in Syria, in its fifth year, constitute the largest share of the displaced, and together with Afghans and Somalis, both still in the throes of sectarian conflict, they comprise more than half of the new refugees counted last year. Q: Where do most of those fleeing conflict seek refuge? A: Neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan were the main recipients of the Syrian exodus until this spring, when warm temperatures and calm waters lured thousands each day to take to the Mediterranean Sea in overcrowded boats headed for the promise of stability and a better life in Europe. More than 500,000 have reached EU territory this year, mostly through southern countries that are reeling under the burden to care for them. The U.N. says more than 2,600 migrants have died this spring and summer attempting the perilous journey ¡X many of them drowning when unseaworthy vessels capsized or suffocating in packed holds of ships and cargo containers. Q: What happens to the migrants when they reach Europe? A: Most EU countries are part of the Schengen Area, the virtually borderless land mass that is home to 400 million and was created by a 1985 treaty named for the village in Luxembourg where it was signed. The free-movement zone includes 22 EU states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Schengen treaty was supplemented in 1990 with the Dublin Rules, which require those seeking asylum to register in the country where they first cross into Schengen territory and are then free to travel within it. However, the countries of the alliance have never agreed on what foreign conflicts qualify fleeing citizens for EU asylum. Nor has there been a common policy developed on what conditions should be created for those appealing for refuge. That has led to the migration free-for-all currently afflicting Europe. Many of the migrants arriving in Greece and Italy decline to make their asylum requests in countries that herd the arrivals in squalid camps and offer little prospect of being permitted to settle and find work. Instead, they try to make their way to Germany, Austria or Scandinavia, where the vast majority of war refugees
receive good care. Q: Which countries are most responsive to the migrants' plight? A: Germany, Europe's largest and wealthiest state, has taken the lead in welcoming migrants leaving Syria and other dangerous venues. Nearly 550,000 have flooded its reception centers this year, and 800,000 are expected by year's end. Less hospitable EU members, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, have criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel for spurring the refugee crisis inundating the continent by offering benefits few other states can afford to provide. She threw the reproach back at her critics, saying Germany's open door should come as ""no surprise given the situation in Syria"" and should be emulated by all EU countries. While Germany has taken in the most migrants, Sweden has welcomed far more as a percentage of its size, with 230,000 arrivals adding more than 2 percent to its population. But the internal EU frictions emanate more from the economic inequities of the member countries. Spain, for example, where one in four adults is unemployed, in principle has rejected proposals for mandatory refugee quotas and in practice has taken in the smallest number relative to its population ¡X 45 per 100,000 citizens compared with Sweden's 2,359 per 100,000.",2
"There's a light at the end of the tunnel ¡X and it's a subway train, finally pulling into New York City's first new station in more than two decades.
Almost two years after its initial promised opening date, a subway stop at 34th street and 11th Avenue is ready for business, adding a new transit option to a part of the city experiencing a construction boom and drawing new visitors to the High Line, the repurposed elevated railway that is now a popular park.
The station on Manhattan's far west side extends the No. 7 train 1 1/2 miles past its current last stop in Times Square, and it's the first station added to the system since 1989. Service is scheduled to start following a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The station will serve the new Hudson Yards project ¡X about 17 million square feet of office, residential and hotel space being built where only rail yards used to be. Transit officials point out it's the only subway line serving the area west of Ninth Avenue below 59th Street. ""It is the centerpiece toward redeveloping the far west side,"" said Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Kevin Ortiz.Construction on the $2.4 billion project, financed by the city, started in 2007 under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and was initially projected to be completed by December 2013, but officials pushed that back several times. Ortiz said the delays stemmed from making sure components like escalators, elevators and some communications systems were in place and running properly. The station is the first in the system to have elevators that travel on an incline like escalators do, and will also maintain a steady temperature of between 72 and 78 degrees on platforms no matter the outside weather. The station is airy, with a multi-hued mosaic on its ceiling and shiny metal railings leading to the platform level. The 7 line extension is one of three major transportation projects the MTA has been working on. The East Side Access project, slated for completion in December 2022, is bringing new tunnels to Manhattan and Queens and a new concourse underneath Grand Central Terminal. The Second Avenue Subway is bringing a new line along Manhattan's far east side, with the first segment from 96th street to 63rd street expected to be complete in December 2016.",2
"Madeline Stuart is a beautiful, bubbly red head who at 18 is already a professional model with a handbag named after her. What is remarkable is that she has Down's Syndrome. Born and bred in Australia, she flew 28 hours across the world to take part in New York fashion week, where she will tread the runway twice -- in couture and resort wear. She is not the first Down's model to walk in New York but her mother celebrates her inclusion as a sign that the stiff, intimidating world of fashion is slowly opening up to more diverse women. ""Madeline is very excited,"" her mother Rosanne Stuart said at rehearsals for the show at Vanderbilt Hall, Grand Central Station -- one of Manhattan's best-loved landmarks. Madeline's career took off when Stuart uploaded photographs of her in May to Facebook, where they quickly went viral.
Within a week, she had 20,000 followers. Today, her Facebook page has been liked by nearly half a million people. The Stuarts head next to the West Coast, where Madeline will collect a prize as model of the year. There are further plans to visit Sweden and even Russia, and she has been nominated for awards in Australia. It's a far cry from the discrimination Rosanne recalls when Madeline was born, being abused in the park and the isolation of living with disability. ""I think people are a lot more open now,"" she said. ""Social media has brought everything to the forefront. Things aren't hidden anymore.""

"China announced that it will formally begin issuing card versions of its travel permit to Taiwanese, a move which has ruffled the feathers of Taiwan¡¦s government. Local Chinese government jurisdictions at the county-level and above will issue the card version of ¡§Taibaozheng¡¨ to Taiwan residents in lieu of the older paper version, which has now been discontinued. Cards will be valid for five years before needing to be renewed, replacing single entry (up to three months) or multiple entry endorsements of up to three years procedures. Andrew Hsia, Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), called the move ¡§very discomforting.¡¨ According to the MAC, China only decided to inform Taiwan of its implementation intentions 20 minutes before it made the decision public. ¡§The very least they could have done was to consult with us. This action is very disrespectful to us,¡¨ Hsia stated angrily. The ""Taibaozheng"" is a document resembling a passport that carries the entry permits for Taiwanese citizens. Critics of the policy in Taiwan say it represents yet another attempt by the Chinese government to shape public perception that the island is a part of its territory. They say that the card bears an uncanny resemblance to a card issued to residents of Hong Kong for purposes of visiting the mainland. The other concern includes a potential security loophole, as the small IC chip embedded into the new card is feared to allow the Chinese government to track the location of the cardholder. In China, passengers purchasing tickets for the high-speed rail are required to provide their full names. In theory, authorities would be able to track the itineraries of Taiwanese residents boarding China¡¦s high-speed rail network and other forms of transport using the new form of identification.",2
"Two weeks after Walt Disney Co. launched a bailout of Euro Disney, another international Disney resort revealed that Its financial woes grew last year. Hong Kong Disneyland reported in February a second consecutive annual loss on an 11 percent drop in attendance and a 7 percent decline in revenue. Park attendance fell to 6.1 million in the most recent fiscal year. In fiscal 2014, Hong Kong Disney s set an attendance record of 7.1 million visitors. Although visits from international tourists increased last year, the resort reported a big decline in attendance from mainland China. The drop coincided with the opening in June of the Shanghai Disney Resort. Travelers from mainland China accounted for 36 percent in Hong Kong Disneyland visitors in fiscal 2016, down from 41 percent in fiscal 2015 and 48 percent in fiscal 2014. Despite the slide in attendance and revenue, Disney is betting that recent additions at the io resort will help boost visitor numbers and spending.

"In 1854, Louis Pasteur assumed the duties of a professor at a university in France. Meanwhile, he conducted studies to find out what caused milk and other drinks containing alcohol to become sour. His breakthrough came when he discovered that the souring was caused by bacteria, in the liquici. He then developed a process through which the bacteria could be removed by boiling the liquid and then cooling it. This method, called pasteurization in his honor, became widespread.  At that time, silk producers were suffering because the eggs of the worms that made the silk were dying from an unknown disease. Pasteur discovered the bacteria that were killing the eggs and developed a method to eliminate the germs. Pasteur next turned his attention to rabies, a deadly disease that animals passed to humans. Many people thought Pasteur was wasting his time, but Pasteur ignored their doubts and continued his efforts to find a cure for rabies. One of his patients was a sick boy, whose mother had turned to Pasteur for help. Pasteur told the mother that he had invented a vaccine that was strong enough to kill the invisible enemy. He said that he would use a needle to inject the vaccine into the boy. The vaccine would then fight the germs, just like a soldier fights in a war. That boy was the first person to receive the vaccine, and the treatment was a success. After that, no one had to be afraid of rabies anymore. People who had laughed at him before, now respected him. Pasteur had believed in himself and had not given up. He had won the battle with the enemy.",2

By helping those with medical conditions succeed in their occupations, occupational therapy, or OT, promotes flourishing as people improve in confidence and function within society.

"The first person to use the term ""occupational therapy"" was George Edward Barton. He opened a facility for people with a wide range of physical and mental conditions in 1914. The term came from his conviction that occupations - activities with a clear purpose - were necessary to help patients recover. In 1917, 100 years ago, the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy (now the American Occupational Therapy Association [AOTA]) was founded, making OT an official profession. The AOTA remains the primary professional organization for OT practitioners and has grown to about 60,000 members. In 1918,soldiers began returning home from World War I, in many cases with disabilities. Occupational therapy techniques helped these soldiers figure out what adaptations were necessary to live with their new conditions.

Players of the popular game must keep the shuttlecock in the air using their feet or any other body part except their hands. Typically, a shuttlecock is made of four feathers attached to a weighted rubber pad or plastic disc. The feathers stabilize the shuttlecock's flight through the air. Informal play can take place anywhere. Some people practice on their own using short kicks to keep the shuttlecock airborne. In group play, players propel the shuttlecock high through the air as they pass it from person to person. Besides keeping the shuttlecock off the ground, they want to show off their skills. Competitive play takes place on special courts, and players in teams kick the shuttlecock over a net. Teams score points when the shuttlecock hits the ground on the opposing team's side of the net. Play is fast-paced and rigorous. Foot shuttlecock play began before the Han dynasty. It may have evolved from cu ju, a ballgame used to train and relax soldiers. The sport spread across Asia and remains very popular today. In mainland China, coworkers organize games during breaks. Individuals of all ages practice jianzi every day for health and diversion. Many swear to its benefits as daily exercise. One man, Fan Tianyuan, had surgery for cancer at the age of 58. Six months later, he won a jianzi competition with 1,798 kicks in a row! In 1999 several countries formed the International Shuttlecock Federation to facilitate international competitions. China and Vietnam are deemed the best competitors, but European nations such as Germany and France also make strong showings in world championships. For official competitions, the standard shuttlecock, featherball or jianqiu, has four goose or duck feathers of equal length, which are short and the same color. However, everyday shuttlecocks can be made of any kind of feather, from chicken to ostrich! All of them have two things in common: fun and exercise!",2
"Wait. You've always wanted to do that, too?! Why don't we do it this summer?!""  Ttat was how it started. My sister and I were talking on the phone when the topic of forest firefighting arose. And, before we knew it, we were seriously talking about doing it together that summer. Fighting wildfires as a summer job may sound bizarre, but it's not uncommon in the western United States. There are at least 50,000 wildfires annually in the U.S., a high number of which occur in the western states. And of course, most occur during the hot months of the year, between May and September. Hence, the need for people willing to work summers fighting these fires is real! Federal agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, as well as private contractors, hire thousands of seasonal firefighters each year. Through a friend, my sister and I were introduced to one of these private contractors. He agreed to hire us for his crew if we took a training course and passed the pack test. Our training consisted of an intensive two-day course on the basics of wildfire management. We learned what causes wildfires, the tools and techniques for fighting them and safety guidelines. The arduous pack test requires a person to walk three miles in under 45 minutes while carrying a 45-pound pack. Since most beginners work on line, engine or Hotshot Crews - all extremely physical - everyone needs to pass this test. And we did! We learned that fighting forest fires involves more than simply spraying water on flames. The goal is to contain the fire, not put it out entirely. This is done mainly with shovels and tools used to remove plants and roots from the ground, creating a line of dirt around the fire. After this, crews watch the line to ensure the fire doesn't flare up. We also did ""mop-up"" tasks - going into the burned areas and dousing or burying hot spots, such as burning tree trunks. Firefighting is difficult and hazardous But it's also rewarding and definitely one of the best summer jobs my sister and I ever had. ",2
"""I need a beach vacation"" I said to my friend Eve, I who responded with, ""Where shall we go?""  We I agreed that Singapore would be ideal! We chose a casual resort on Sentosa Island that looks out over Singapore Strait Because it is a two-minute walk to Siloso Beach, we frequented it every day - often before breakfast. We couldn't spend our entire time on the beach, so one day we ventured over to the Singapore Zoo. We stayed into the evening to experience Singapore's Night Safari. This nocturnal zoo offers a different experience - including a snake that slithered across our path! We explored part on foot and then hopped on a tram to ride through big game country in the inky blackness. Another day we strolled through the 156-year-old Singapore Botanic Gardens, a UNESCO Worid Heritage Site. At the north end, the National Orchid Garden features the world's largest collection of tropical orchids - lovely! And we didn't miss Jurong Bird Park, the Raffles Hotel or shopping, either. Having dinner and watching the sunset at one of the outdoor cafes on our beach was the perfect ending to each perfect day.",2
"When Merriam Cooper was a boy, he loved reading novels like Lost in the Jungle and Wild Life Under the Equator, both of which were written by Paul Du Chaillu. Set in Africa,they told exciting tales of imaginary native tribes battling hippopotamuses and man-eating tigers. Years later, Cooper joined the U.S. military and flew bombing missions during the First World War. After the conflict ended, he met Ernest B. Schoedsack, an expert with movie cameras. The two of them traveled around eastern Africa and India. Moved by their own adventures, they decided to begin making movies that could capture the danger and delight of exploring strange lands, living with native tribes and dealing with hostile creatures. After making three movies, namely, Grass, Chang and The Four Feathers, the partners came up with the idea of making one about a giant gorilla. Originally, they wanted to use a real gorilla in the movie. That turned out to be too expensive, however, so they instead used a model of a gorilla and a new technique called stop-motion photography to bring the creature to life. The resulting movie was King Kong. In 1976, Kong's unfortunate story was retold with a man in a suit with makeup and a robot. When director Peter Jackson got his hands on Kong in 2005, Kong was portrayed by an actor and special effects. While the major ""King Kong movies tell a similar story, Kong has been portrayed in many different ways over the years. In one of the sillier movies, King Kong Escapes (1967), he fights a mechanical copy of himself. King Kong Lives (1986) takes a stranger turn with Kong surviving his famous tumble and falling for Lady Kong.",2
"In January, then I President-elect I Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal he would keep sanctions imposed by the Obama administration against Russia in place ""for a period of time."" He said he would lift them should Russian President Vladimir Putin prove that he can be an ally. ""If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?"" Trump was quoted as saying during an interview with the Journal a week before he was inaugurated. At stake is whether Trump will take a conciliatory stance against Russia after President Obama s sanctions for cyberattacks aimed at interfering with the 2016 presidential campaign. After Russian operatives were expelled from the U.S., Russia's president said his government wouldn't retaliate because he was waiting for Trump to take office. Trump responded with a Twitter post in which he called Putin ""Very smart."" In mid-January Trump did acknowledge that Russia was responsible for hacking email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. He has nonetheless said that he hopes to have a better relationship with Moscow.",2
"Dungeness crab are forecast to take a hit from ocean acidification driven by fossil-fuel combustion, according to a new study. Though the populations of the Dungeness crab fluctuate year by year, their overall abundance by 2063 could be about 30 percent lower, according to Issac Kaplan, a co-author of the study. ""We think that there will be a moderate decline in a species that is really economically important,"" said Kaplan. The study was published in Global Change Biology and had nine co-authors.
Scientists have found that the seawater is growing more acidic due to carbon-dioxide emissions. While most of this carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, about a third of it is absorbed by the oceans. As this acidity rises, the water can be more corrosive on some animals' shells or skeletons as documented in the 2013 Seattle Times series ttSea Change""",2
"In January, European governments, stunned by President-elect Donald Trum's remarks slamming NATO and saying other European Union nations would follow the U.K. out of the blocT called for cool heads and closer unity. In interviews with the Times of London and Germany's Bild, Trump said leaving the 28-nation EU would be good for Britain. And he described the 67 year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization as obsolete. Trump's remarks call into question the depth of U.S. support for European defense and trade, which has helped cement the region's post-World War II order and brought former Soviet-bloc countries into the EU and NATO.  Trump also promised the U.K. a quick trade agreement and portrayed the EU as an instrument of German domination designed with the purpose of beating the U.S. in international trade. For that reason, Trump said, he's fairly indifferent to whether the EU stays together, according to BUd. The remarks are causing ""astonishment"" and ""agitation"" across the EU and concern at NATO headquarters, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters in January. ""We do expect our American partner to stick to commitments under international law and to WTO rules.""",2
"On August 26,2013, I stood outside Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland. I was about to begin my freshman year in an American high school. Growing up in Taipei, I'd always thought of high school as scary. My older friends complained about getting just three hours of sleep a night because of all the homework. Some even told me that upperclassmen would throw underclassmen into trashcans. Trembling, I opened the door and started down the hallway lined with lockers Students stood at their lockers getting out supplies. The locker doors slammed shut as students headed to their first class. Soon I was heading to mine. There were seven class periods a day with each 45-minute class in a different classroom. Students had five minutes to get from one class to another, but it usually took longer because the hallways were so packed. Students often shoved one another out of their way to make it in time. At first I kept to myself to avoid attention, but then I realized that I'd been scared for no reason. High school was anything but a horrifying place, and people did not get thrown into trashcans!",2
"As Sunny and her friend Peggy from Hong Kong tour Taipei on YouBikes, Sunny fills her friend in on some of the local traffic rules.  Peggy:Getting around Taipei is really convenient. You can ride a YouBike everywhere. A lot of people seem to be riding bicycles.  Sunny : There are several rules you have to follow though. Peggy:Are bicycles on the road considered pedestrians or vehicles? Sunny :Bicydes are treated as ""slow-moving vehicles"" You can ride them on normal roads, but only on the right side. Peggy :Oh, OK. Sunny:Taipei has many bike lanes that separate bikes and pedestrians, and we re going to ride on bike exclusive lanes If you ride in a shared-use lane on a sidewalk, you have to yield to pedestrians. Electric bikes are barred from sidewalk bike lanes or dty district bike paths for safety reasons becsuse they can go up to 25 kilometers per hour. Peggy:Is that an elementary school up ahead? It looks like kids are headed home. Sunny:Let's get off our bikes and walk them along the bike path. Peggy:OK....Some people are riding their bikes on sidewalks under the overhangs of buildings. Is that allowed? Sunny:They are for pedestrians only. Violators can be fined from NT$300 to NTS600. Peggy:There's a green light. Can we make a direct left turn? Sunny:At this intersection, we need to turn left in two separate steps, like motorbikes. Also, it's against the law to use a mobile phone while riding a bike, riding at night without a light, riding after drinking, carrying a passenger, riding in the wrong direction, going through a red light or riding side by side. Peggy:Wow. I've learned a lot today. The next time I come to Taiwan with friends, I can take them around Taipei by bike!",1
"Bees are amazing! They are also very important. Everyone knows that honeybees make honey. But bees do a lot of other things, too. They make beeswax which can be used for everything from food to hand cream. They also help people grow food. When bees collect pollen for food, they pollinate plants. Many fruit and nut trees are pollinated by bees. Most bees live in hives, in groups called colonies. Each colony has thousands of worker bees but only one queen . The queen's job is to produce eggs. Without a queen, a colony will die. All worker bees are female. They clean the hive, make honey and take care of the eggs. Colonies also have a few male bees called drones. They don't stay in a hive very long. People that take care of bees are called beekeepers. Right now, they have a big problem. Many bees are leaving their hives and disappearing. Nobody is really sure why this is happening. A polluted environment might be one problem. Poisons  that farmers use might also be a problem. The bees could also be getting sick. But people need to solve this problem. We need healthy bees!",1

"Gustav: Yvette, I know how much you enjoy visiting some of the older parts of Taipei, such as Dihua Street and the Wanhua area, formerly known as Monga. But what can you tell me about the Taipei Botanical Garden, especially the Guest House of Imperial Envoys inside the garden? Yvette: It¡¦s been some time since I've headed over to that part of the city. That building was part of the Bu-Cheng-Shih-Sz Office in the Ching Dynasty. Gustav: So high-level officials from imperial China stayed there during their visit. Yvette: That¡¦s correct. But keep in mind that the building was constructed in 1892, and just three years later Taiwan was under Japanese control. Gustav: Okay, because clearly from an architectural standpoint, it¡¦s not of Japanese design. Now I see why, as it had already been built by the time of Japan¡¦s arrival in 1895. Yvette: What makes it so important architecturally is it¡¦s the only remaining Ching Dynasty administrative building in Taiwan. Gustav: It¡¦s a building of understated beauty. With all the lush vegetation of the botanical garden that surrounds it, any envoy staying there must have enjoyed being serenaded by birds and cicadas. Yvette: Remember, though, that it was originally situated on the land now occupied by Zhongshan Hall. It was moved to its present location by the Japanese in 1933. The original complex was seven times larger than what stands in the Taipei Botanical Garden today. Yvette: Remember, though, that it was originally situated on the land now occupied by Zhongshan Hall. It was moved to its present location by the Japanese in 1933. The original complex was seven times larger than what stands in the Taipei Botanical Garden today. Gustav: So, if the whole thing had been relocated , it would¡¦ve occupied a huge chunk of the botanical garden. Yvette: Indeed. But even though it was used as lodgings for envoys in the Ching Dynasty, from 1895 to 1919 it functioned as the office of the Governor General of Taiwan. Gustav: The official holding this position was no doubt Japanese. Yvette: No doubt. By 1919 the new Governor General¡¦s Office was completed. Today we call that the Presidential Office Building. Gustav: I heard that structure was heavily damaged in bombing runs by the United States military. Yvette: That¡¦s true. That happened in 1945 in May. Gustav: And the Japanese governor general escaped unharmed I suppose. Yvette: Yes. Speaking of damage inflicted by U.S. planes at the time, it¡¦s said that some of the oldest palms in the botanical garden still have bullet holes in them from stratlng by low-flying American fighters. We¡¦re talking about the ones near the Bo Ai Road entrance to the garden. Gustav: The Guest House of Imperial Envoys wasn¡¦t targeted. Yvette: Thankfully.",2
"Cass: Before we play video games check out- my latest DIY project. Vickie: Whoa, are those made of floppy disks? Cass: Yep. Since my brother is really into gardening right now, I made him a set of floppy disk planters. They were superisingly eady to make, but don't tell him that. Vickie: My lips are sealed ! Why did you have so many floppy disks laying around? Cass: So-called outdated technology is really useful. You know, a lot of successful people in the world don¡¦t use email. Vickie: Name one. Cass: Sure. John Paul Dejoria, CEO of Paul Mitchell hair care products, refuses to use email. I¡¦ll name another for good measure Christopher Nolan, the director of the Batman trilogy, and tons of other blockbusters, refuses to use a mobile phone. Vickie: I can't believe that!Cass: I couldn¡¦t either, but the proof is in the pudding and their reasons are pretty good. Dejoria is a fan of writing letters and making phone calls because he thinks emails are too impersonal. In his words, it helps him focus on the ¡§vital few.¡¨ Vickie: What about Christopher Nolan? I always thought Hollywood was a high-tech place. Cass: Well, Nolan is a little different. He never needed to begin using email and he actually does use other people¡¦s cell phones. But he thinks cell phones are a distractions and a time suck so he¡¦s very happy without his own. Vickie: Maybe it¡¦s easy for high-powered executives to live without email because they can boss everyone else around. Cass: That¡¦s probably true. I like old technology too, though. I think it¡¦s charming. If I keep using my old stuff, then I don¡¦t have to troubleshoot any new problems. For example, I always know when my 10-year-old printer is going to fail me and I always know exactly how to fix it. Plus, using old tech lowers my environmental impact. Don¡¦t you know anyone who loves outdated technology? Vickie: Yeah, the retro style is so trendy right now. All of my friends have instant cameras, even though the pictures look so bad. I even saw an app to make smartphone videos look like videotape recordings. Cass: I like retro tech because it¡¦s simple and fun to tinker with. However, I'm undecided about brand new products that look old. Vickie: Really? I think it¡¦s irresistible! Actually, I have a pillowcase with a cassette tape print. I think marketers know how to appeal to our love for outdated technology. Cass: I know what you mean. The other day, I saw a car commercial that combined real life with a 1987 Nintendo game. It gave me such a strong feeling of nostalgia that I went out to test drive the car. Can you believe that? Vickie: Wow, show me the commercial. Cass: Okay. You can watch while I set up the video game. ",2
"Carmen: I can¡¦t believe we finally saved up enough to do this. Ezra: Me neither. This has been a dream of ours for what, five years? Carmen: Just about. Ever since my cousin Daniela showed us photos of Amalfi, we¡¦ve had it at the top of our travel bucket lists. We¡¦ll be able to explore the Sorrentine Peninsula, including Sorrento, Positano, and Amalfi, where we¡¦ll be based. Ezra: Don¡¦t forget the island of Capri! We have to see the magical Blue Grotto¡Xa sea cave filled with dazzling azur light. The mouth of the cave is only one meter high and two meters wide, so people can only enter if they lie flat in a rowboat guided by an oarsman. Carmen: The blue grotto was both a water temple and a personal swimming pool of Roman Emperor Tiberius in the first century. It¡¦s cool and all, but I¡¦m a little scared of that, to be honest. Ezra: If the tide¡¦s too high or the waves are too choppy, the oarsmen won¡¦t take tourists in. Carmen: That¡¦s a relief. If the conditions are right, let¡¦s go for it! Swimming¡¦s not allowed, though. I read that the miraculous light is created by light coming through two holes ¡Xthe mouth of the cave, and a much larger hole beneath the water, invisible to the naked eye People can see how light- filled the water is. It¡¦s enchanting! Ezra: The rest of the Amalfi Coast is famously picturesque, too. Lonely Planet zones in on my favorite part: ¡§coastal mountains plunge into the sea in a stunning vertical scene of precipitous crags, picturesque towns and lush forests.¡¨ The dramatic beauty is unmatched ,which is why it¡¦s been a tourism hotspot for centuries.  Carmen: Don¡¦t get me wrong, I appreciate the gorgeous views of aqua sea from the jagged cliffs, and I¡¦m excited to do touristy things, like drink limoncello, eat gelato, and enjoy the beach. I just think Amalfi¡¦s history as the capital of a maritime republic and big trading power is the coolest part. It was established as a trading post in the 4th century! Ezra: The Amalfi Coast was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 for its cultural landscape. In the Middle Ages, the town was the capital of the Duchy of Amalfi, a de facto independent state. Its merchants dominated the trading scene in the Mediterranean in the 10th and 11th centuries, before being overpowered by Pisa and Venice. Carmen: Amalfi fell to the Normans in 1073, and failed twice to regain power. It had previously been able to free itself from Byzantine vassalage in 839. Ezra: How does all that affect present-day Amalfi? Carmen: After its Medieval period, Amalfi became a popular tourist destination among English aristocracy and remains so among globe-trotters. Visitors love the steep, narrow lanes and the beautiful 11th century cathedral. Today, its small population hovers around 5,000.",2
" Donna: Back home in Missouri, in the house you grew up in, did you have a pantry? Thane: We had one wall in the kitchen that had a floor-to-ceiling cabinet. It looked like a clothes closet with two big doors. Inside were many shelves holding many types of food. A lot of the stuff was canned goods, like soup, canned corn, canned tuna, and whatnot. But my mom also kept pasta in there and things like bagged beans. On the bottom shelf she kept things like fresh potatoes, yams and onions. Donna: I¡¦m just asking because I¡¦ve heard that other folks have an entire room called a pantry. I think it¡¦s also for storing food. Thane: People with big homes definitely might have walk-in pantries. Why do you ask? Donna: My teacher at the English bushiban gave us a handout about the ¡§Little Free Pantry¡¨ in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and he wants us to talk about it in class next week. Thane: Coincidentall , I read about that online. It¡¦s basically a wooden box on a pole next to a sidewalk in a low-income area of town. Donna: Considering its size and appearance shouldn¡¦t it be called a ¡§cupboard¡¨ instead of a pantry? Thane: One potential problem with calling it a cupboard is that indicates cups, glasses, bowls, dishes and the like. Or, if you¡¦re a Harry Potter reader, you might think of a broom closet under the stairs ¡X referred to as a ¡§cupboard¡¨ in those books. Donna: The purpose of the Little Free Pantry is to address food insecurity. Thane: Which is a euphemism for hunger, isn¡¦t it? Donna: Or the idea that some people don¡¦t know where their next meal is coming from. So, for people of Fayetteville who might otherwise go to bed hungry, this pantry box is a real godsend. Thane: I¡¦ll say. The food placed in there lasts no longer than 40 minutes on average. Clearly there¡¦s big demand. Donna: What I was concerned about initially was the potential for vandalism of the pantry, or the tampering of the food inside.Thane: It sits on church property, and some claim that provides something of a blessing to the box and its contents. But the people who donate seem genuinely concerned with helping the needy. Jessica McClard was inspired to start the pantry after noticing how popular the Little Free Library boxes around town were with readers. Donna: It¡¦s worth pointing out the pantry stocks more than just food. Some people put toiletries in there, while others leave diapers. School supplies have been left there, too, which makes sense as a school is located across the street. Thane: And the Blessing Box in Ardmore Oklahoma and the Little Free Pantry in New Castle, Pennsylvania, are two examples of other free pantries that followed Fayetteville¡¦s lead.",2

Do you have any better suggestions? Christina: I do. Have you ever gone to an escape room? Robbie: No, and I never will! You and Kyra should go without me. Christina: You don¡¦t want to go with us? Robbie: I would like to, but I¡¦m claustrophobic . Getting locked inside a room and working through puzzles in order to escape sounds like a deathtrap. Christina: Don¡¦t be so dramatic.The other day, you said you wished you could be a secret agent for a day. What happened to your sense of adventure? Robbie: Christina, don¡¦t you know I¡¦m all talk? Christina: It¡¦ll be fun! Everyone is saying escape rooms are the hottest alternative to movies because they¡¦re interactive Aren¡¦t you tired of sitting on a couch and watching a movie? Why not act out the movie and pretend to be the hero for an hour! Robbie: Only an hour? I guess it can¡¦t hurt to hear more about these escape rooms. What else do you know? Christina: That¡¦s the spirit! I admit some of the scenarios are scary. I found one escape room themed around a horror movie. That one would probably give me a few sleepless nights. However, I found a different escape room with large-scale environments. At this company, you¡¦re never locked inside a room. How does that sound? Robbie: That doesn¡¦t sound too bad.

Christina: She doesn¡¦t like easy puzzles, but she loves tough competition. We¡¦ll be competing against other teams to beat the scenario. Trust me, she¡¦ll love this. Robbie: It¡¦s true she would do anything to win a competition. Christina: Exactly. I think we have a good chance of crushing the other teams.

"Benny: Yay! The Cubs won! Shelly: I heard. Are you a Chicago fan? Benny: Not really, but I love seeing an underdog win. I also hate to see devoted fans suffer so much disappointment. Shelly: I agree. Hey, what¡¦s this hubbub about some curse involving a goat? Benny: Well, most people didn¡¦t really believe in it, but the media perpetuated it for decades. The supposed curse began in 1945, when the Cubs management decided to ban William Sianis¡¦ goat from the stadium. Sianis owned a local tavern, where he used the goat as a mascot to attract customers. As a marketing gimmick, he would buy two tickets to Cubs games and bring the goat. Shelly: Haha, those were different times. But why did the Cubs kick out the goat? Benny: Because other fans complained that it smelled bad. Then Sianis supposedly got angry and cursed the team. Shelly: This story seems pretty silly. Benny: I think so too. But whenever any sports team has a long losing streak, rumors of a curse always appear. Another example is the Curse of the Black Sox. The 1919 Chicago White Sox are remembered as the Black Sox because eight players were bribed by gamblers to lose the World Series on purpose. They did lose that year, and never won again until 2005! Shelly: So, why did the Cubs finally win this year? Benny: They simply had the best team. Their record this year was 103-58, and out of the 29 other teams the next-best record was 95-67. But the Cubs were also fortunate. The championship is a best-of-7 series, and they were down 3 games to 1 before rallying to win three consecutive games. And in game 7 they almost blew it! Shelly: What happened? Benny: They were winning 6-3 with one out in the 8th inning,   and they let Cleveland tie the game. I¡¦m sure most Cubs fans were having a heart attack. This was one of the most exciting Game 7s ever, and to make it even more of a nail-biter there was even a 17-minute rain delay after the 9th inning. The Cubs finally won it 8-7 in 10 innings. Shelly: That¡¦s insane. I¡¦m glad the Cubs were victorious, but I feel bad for Cleveland¡¦s fans. Benny: You should. Now that Chicago has shattered its 108-year curse, the Cleveland Indians have replaced them as the team ¡X in any American sport - with the longest futility   streak. They last won it in 1948, so it¡¦s 68 years and counting. Shelly: Ah, now I understand why the World Series was such a big deal this year. It was a battle between the two most jinxed teams. Benny: Yes, and people couldn¡¦t wait to see which one of them would finally win. We¡¦l] probably never have this kind of scenario again. Benny: They were winning 6-3 with one out in the 8th inning,   and they let Cleveland tie the game. I¡¦m sure most Cubs fans were having a heart attack. This was one of the most exciting Game 7s ever, and to make it even more of a nail-biter there was even a 17-minute rain delay after the 9th inning. The Cubs finally won it 8-7 in 10 innings. Shelly: That¡¦s insane. I¡¦m glad the Cubs were victorious, but I feel bad for Cleveland¡¦s fans. Benny: You should.

May: Watching a speech Michelle Obama delivered in London about Let Girls Learn and global girls¡¦ education. Did you know 62 million girls worldwide aren¡¦t in school, and there are millions more fighting to stay there? Ricardo: Whoa. In the back of my mind I knew gender inequality is a global problem, and girls in some parts of the world face greater barriers  to education. But I had no idea the number was that high. That¡¦s a violation  of the human right to education. May: Everybody knows Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, the teenager who defied  the Taliban in Pakistan by demanding girls¡¦ right to education. Generally, people support her aims , but many don¡¦t know much about the huge number of girls also fighting that same fight, or about the varied roadblocks they face. Ricardo: I¡¦m guilty of that. Malala survived an attempt on her life and continued her activism right? That takes serious guts. May: Yup. Michelle described the situation as ¡§grown men trying to snuff out the aspirations of young girls.¡¨ But it¡¦s not just extremist groups that try to prevent girls¡¦ education. Resources and attitudes play a big role. Ricardo: So I take it Let Girls Learn is doing something to close the gap. How¡¦re they doing it? May: They drummed up support right away. When Michelle launched LGL, the hashtag #62milliongirls became number one in the US and number three worldwide. People were telling their stories and honoring Michelle¡¦s message: girls are ¡§worthy of developing their boundless potential.¡¦¡¦ Ricardo: Amazing! May: Michelle and her team have met with girls worldwide, listened to experts, and partnered with government agencies, companies, organizations, and individuals ¡Xincluding kids! They¡¦ve raised hundreds of millions of dollars. The Peace Corps has implemented 100 LGL programs in 22 countries so far. Ricardo: I heard more than 200 countries in the U.N. agreed to prioritize girls¡¦ adolescent education. Is that what LGL is focused on? May: Yes. During adolescence, many girls are pulled out of school and told to focus on home responsibilities. Some families can¡¦t afford to educate girls any longer, while a lack of resources to manage menstruation, such as sanitary pads and girls¡¦ bathrooms, makes attending school nearly impossible for others. Forced child marriage is also a big problem, and ends the school careers of many girls. LGL works to address all of these issues. Ricardo: Wow. We can chalk it up to the ingrained belief that girls¡¦ education matters less than boys¡¦,in addition to few resources. May: Exactly. It¡¦s a daunting task, but it¡¦s extraordinarily hopeful. Michelle said, ¡§I truly see myself in these girls. In their burning determination to rise above their circumstances  and reach for something more. And I know that many of you do too.¡¨",2
"Luke: Hey Deirdre. Are you sick? Deirdre: No, I¡¦m not sick, exactly. The pollution is just really bothering me lately. The smell of exhaust from vehicle has been making me feel a little nauseous, and I can feel that my breathing is a little strained, especially when I exercise. I feel like my apartment doesn¡¦t get much fresh air, either. My window looks over the street. Luke: Oh wow. Maybe you should see a doctor. But in the meantime, it might be a good idea to head over to the Flower Market. Deirdre: Why? Luke: Sounds like you could use some houseplants. Some are especially good at oxygenating and detoxifying the air. I¡¦ve got some in my dorm. Deirdre: Good idea. I¡¦ll give it a shot! Luke: Let¡¦s head over there now. Deirdre: Okay. So, which plants are most? Luke: I¡¦ve perused a lot of online lists with titles like ¡§15 Plants for Cleaner Air.¡¨ Those I trust the most have been compiled from NASA research on houseplants from the late 1980s. The peace lily removes mold from the air. It absorbs mold spores through its leaves, then transports them to the roots to use as food. You can even put them in the bathroom, to reduce mildew. Deirdre: I need that! Luke: Like aloe vera, English ivy, and the spider plant, the peace lily also gets rid of benzene and formaldehyde, two toxic substances found in home decor, cleaning supplies, office supplies, paint¡Xwe¡¦re also exposed to them via motor fuel inhalation. Luke: Spider plants are. They won in NASA¡¦s preliminary tests, too. In just 24 hours, spider plants removed 95% of the formaldehyde from a sealed Plexiglas chamber. Deirdre: That¡¦s amazing. I wonder how many they had in there. Luke: I¡¦m not sure, but NASA says to use one plant per 100 square feet of space; it can¡¦t hurt to have more. Deirdre: Wait...spider plants can also be called mother-in-law¡¦s tongue, right? Luke: That would be the snake plant. It also improves air quality by converting CO2 into oxygen at night. Deirdre: That reminds me, a while ago I watched a TED Talk by Kamal Meattle about household plants. Back in ¡¥92 he couldn¡¦t tolerate the air in New Delhi, and his lungs were only working at 70%. So he used that NASA data to inform 15 years of studies in his own IT building. He used over 1,200 plants for 300 occupants in a 50,000 square feet building. Luke: What¡¦d he find? Deirdre: The bamboo palm, spider plant, and money plant are crucial. In 2008, the Indian government did a study on Meattle¡¦s building, and called it the healthiest building in New Delhi. Occupants also had drastic improvements in problems related to eye irritation, respiration, headaches, lung impairment, and asthma. Luke: Plants are no joke!",2
"Esther: Hey, wanna go to the movies with me on Sunday night? Jay: Are you sure? I thought we had our biology lab at 7:30 Monday morning. Esther: No class. It¡¦s Martin Luther King Jr. Day! Jay: What¡¦s that? As an international student, I¡¦m sometimes not up to speed on smaller holidays. Esther: Sure, I can fill you in. You¡¦ve heard of MLK, right? Jay: Yup. I don¡¦t know a ton, but I know he was a leader in the Civil Rights- Movement of the 1960s. Esther: Reverend King was the most prominent leader of the movement. He was famous for advocating nonviolent activism, and closely studied grassroots leaders like Gandhi, who was his role model. MLK delivered his history-making ¡§I Have A Dream¡¨ speech during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. Jay: The Civil Rights Movement endeavored to end racial discrimination in state and federal law, and succeeded, right? Esther: Precisely. Black Americans were often treated brutally in much of the country, and were targets of racist violence, especially in the American South, which was a hotbed"" of Jim Crow. Jay: Given that people were treated worse than animals, it¡¦s kind of amazing that King and so many other people would respond with nonviolence. Esther: Good point. Many agree with you. Jay: Nonviolence is basically taking the high road-, but I¡¦m not sure it can ensure that oppressed minorities actually receive the equal treatment and freedom they¡¦re protesting for.Esther: I tend to agree with you. I absolutely admire MLK for his ideals, which came out of his faith and moral stance. Nonviolence did help the cause; images on television of police officers and mobs intimidating and physically attacking nonviolent protesters of several races drew sympathy from a considerable amount of white Americans. But, he was still assassinated, and the FBI and the Memphis Police Department admitted their involvement decades later. jay: Yeah, nonviolence in the face of violence takes a ton of courage. I¡¦ve seen photos of protesters being attacked, and not physically fighting back at all. I didn¡¦t know the FBI was involved in MLK¡¦s assassination! That¡¦s horrible. Esther: It is. Other leaders didn¡¦t agree that purely nonviolent tactics were the best or only method of liberating Black Americans from racial inequality and poverty. Huey Newton, one of the founders of the Black Panther Party, famously said: ¡§In order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience12. The United States has none, has none.¡¨ Jay: Wow, that¡¦s deep. Despite progress, racist violence continues still today. We can see that in the present-day murders of Black Americans by police. Totally unacceptable. Esther: Whenever we feel disillusioned13, we gotta remember MLK¡¦s words: ¡§We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.¡¨ We can still make a better world. ",2
"Neil: Are you psyched? Ashley: About what? Neil: As a movie buff I thought you¡¦d be salivating over the upcoming announcement of the Oscar nominations. Ashley: I¡¦ve been so swamped with projects at work, and haven¡¦t paid much attention to recent releases. Neil: Keep in mindqualify for consideration, movies must have played in both New York and Los Angeles before December 31¡Aeven if in limited release at a single theater in each city. Ashley: Once the actual Oscars are awarded, which will be in February this year, those films go into wide release. that some films that receive nominations 01 one sort or another haven¡¦t been officially released yet.To qualify for consideration, movies must have played in both New York and Los Angeles before December 31¡Aeven if in limited release at a single theater in each city. Ashley: Once the actual Oscars are awarded, which will be in February this year, those films go into wide release. Neil: You mean among films that saw limited release prior to the ceremony. But some films that got nominated were released much earlier in the year. I recall how Silence of the Lambs was released very early in 1991, but went on to win Best Picture. But that was kind of a rar case. Ashley: So which pictures do you expect to receive nominations this year? Weil: As for Best Picture contenders, I¡¦d say safe bets include La La Land,Manchester by the Sea¡AJackie, Fences, Loving and Silence. Ashley: The only films I¡¦ve heard of among those are the first and last. La La Land has gotten a lot of press. And Silence has received much attention in Taiwan because it was mostly shot here. Neil: La La Land is guaranteed to get a lot of nominations, and could easily win Best Picture. ¡§La La Land¡¨ is a nickname for Los Angeles, the city it¡¦s set in. As a love letter to Hollywood, it tells the story of a budding actress and a jazz musician. Oscar voters always love films that deal with Hollywood, either directly as The Artist did, or indirectly as in the case of Birdman. Ashley: What are Silence's chances? Neil: Any Martin Scorsese picture always has a great chance at winning big. Let¡¦s not forget, though, The Departed was the first Best Picture win for the director after six losses. If Silence brings more attention to Taiwan, even though the story is set in Japan, I¡¦ll be very happy. Liam Neeson and Andrew Garfield may get Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nods. Garfield could even get nominated for Best Actor in Hacksaw Ridge. Ashley: Let¡¦s not forget the actresses. Emma Stone could get recognized for La La Land. Neil: As will Natalie Portman for Jackie and Meryl Streep, again, for Florence Foster Jenkins. Ashley: Any surprise predictions? Neil: The sci-fi flick Arrival is good enough to be considered for Best Picture, but along with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, it¡¦ll probably get lots of technical award nominations.",2

Shauna: I didn¡¦t bring a handkerchief, so don¡¦t make me cry. Shane: Shedding a few tears never hurt anyone. Besides, we¡¦re the only ones here in this cafe, so no one will see you anyway. Shauna: It is a great little spot here in this museum. Too bad I didn¡¦t know a bit earlier that you could sit and drink a cup of coffee in Taipei while taking in an impressive display of dinosaur bones at the same time. I love this view from up here, looking down on those prehistoric beasts below. Shane: These dinos in the Land Bank Exhibition Hall of the National Taiwan Museum are one of this city¡¦s best-kept secrets. But did you hear about the prehistoric bones at the National Museum of Scotland? Shauna: That¡¦s just down the street from my home in Edinburgh. Shane: Well, a particular collection of one- of-a-kind bones was hidden away there for 50 years before resurfacing this past summer. Shauna: That sounds exciting! But how could dinosaur bones go missing in a museum, considering they must have been pretty big bones? Shane: Big, yes. Dinosaur, well, not exactly. They belong to a creature1= that scientists call the ¡§Storr Lochs Monster.¡¨ Its bones were found in rock protruding from a beach on the Isle of Skye. Shauna: That¡¦s in the Inner Hebrides, an island chain off the west coast of Scotland.I Shane: The amateur paleontologist who stumbled upon- the bones contacted the museum, which in turn sent a team that cut the rock holding the fossil. It was only last year, however, that museum personnel got around to freeing the bones and determining what they had in their possession. Shauna: You mentioned a ¡§monster.¡¨Shane: It really qualifies as one, based on the description. It was four meters long with a mouth filled with hundreds of jagged teeth. If it didn¡¦t open its mouth, however, it could almost pass for a really long dolphin. Shauna: Except that it lived before the first dolphins appeared. Shane: Right. In those days dinosaurs ruled the land, and fish-like reptiles called ichthyosaurus ruled the seas. Shauna: Which era are we talking about? Shane: Jurassic. Shauna: Figures. But I just find it interesting to note that the most famous monster of the deep in Scotland, the Loch Ness Monster, probably isn¡¦t even real. This ichthyosaurus, by contrast, is proof that Scotland really did have sea monsters!",2

"The reason this hard-boiling works so well is really pretty simple, but it helps to know a little bit about how eggs work. Eggs consist largely of protein ¡X mixed with mostly water in the white, or albumen, and mixed with fat and water in the. When the eggs are raw, the proteins are like strands of yarn curled up in little balls. As the eggs are heated, these strands relax and. As they, they bump into each other and link up. (Fun fact: This is why egg ""whites,"" which are clear when raw, are white when cooked ¡X the unfurled, linked-up block light from passing through.)",1
"The higher the temperature, the the linkages, at first getting firmer but gradually getting tight enough that they squeeze out the. That's bad. Even worse, as the egg white warms, it gives off sulfide gas and when that gas meets the iron in the it forms iron sulfide, which is what that green ring is made from. The perfect temperature for a hard-cooked egg is right around 160 degrees (actually a little lower for the white, which doesn't have any fat to it, and a little higher for the yolk, but we'll settle for an average).",1
"This cooking technique is so spot-on because by the time the temperature of the inside of the egg warms to that point, the water has already started cooling, preventing any overcooking. (In my experiments, I found that between 12 and 13 minutes after I removed the pan from the heat, the temperature of the water had already dropped below 160 degrees ¡X essentially stopping the cooking process.)",1
"Furthermore, because the eggs are heated gradually (as opposed to dropping cold eggs into boiling water), you won't have any problems with shells cracking during cooking. That cracking is caused by the sudden heat causing the air pockets inside the eggs to expand rapidly. When the eggs are heated gradually, the air can leak gently out through the porous shells (indeed, you can see the bubbles emerging).And one final hint: The eggs will be much easier to shell if after cooking you give them a gentle crack and then put them in an ice water bath. The cold shrinks the egg just enough to pull it away from the shell. This will be even easier if you use older eggs ¡X the chemistry of the egg changes as it ages, making the white less ""sticky.""",1

"""They the pain and of a whole generation,"" wrote author Lian Si, a sociologist who spent two years living with and the graduates. ""When all their anger and grievances reach a critical point, a special event could a mass movement.""",1
"Beijing is urging state-run companies to put college graduates on their payrolls, and it's encouraging degree to work in the countryside. Others are being steered into the military. State media have reported female graduates seeking marriage just end their fruitless job hunt.",1
"The ants' story began a little over a ago, in 1999, when the Chinese government an plan to university enrollment by 30%. At the time, the country's factories were suffering from the Asian financial crisis. Planners believed a rise in college rolls would help China transition from a largely export-driven,  to a more one by white-collar workers.",1
"enrollment quintupled to 20 million students by 2008; last year 6.1 million Chinese earned diplomas, up from 1 million in 1999. But it soon became clear there weren't enough suitable jobs for these freshly graduates. Beijing has college enrollment growth to 5% annually.",1
"""Everyone's realized the government has failed to create enough jobs,"" said Su Hong, 23. The graduate was one of 1 million Chinese who took a civil service exam in December to compete for 15,000 openings. ""People's are getting lower and lower,"" she said.",1
"For grad Guan, a college degree was to be a leg up from his working-class roots in Fushun, an industrial city best known for its open-pit coal mine.After graduating last year from Bohai University in his home of Liaoning, a region better known to as Manchuria, Guan headed for Beijing. He was one of thousands to apply for work at a television station. He made it to the final round of six. Two were chosen, but not he.",1
"off the he joined three college buddies living in a cheap called Fuyuanmen, or Gate of Fortune and Destiny, in a far-northwest section of the capital. Homeowners there, sensing the for affordable started putting additions on their square, gray-brick houses. Guan's landlord purchased two prefabricated metal shelters, the type used to house Chinese laborers on sites, and attached them to his roof. He then subdivided them like rabbit hutches to create four rooms, each about the size of a typical American bathroom.",1
"To reach his room, Guan must climb a to the roof, which doubles as a patio. The four friends share one sink and cook on an electric hot plate covered with a waxy of. The quarters are often but Guan's Manchurian roots have toughened him to Beijing's frosty winters.",1
"Guan has done what he can to enliven his. He laid interlocking colored foam on the floor to act as a carpet. He hung a $1 poster of. His visited from Liaoning province and affixed cartoon monkey stickers to the tatty walls. She gave him a teddy bear in denim overalls. It sleeps with Guan under his Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck bed sheets. Nearby is an empty cookie box where he stores his DVDs. One of his favorites is Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 classic ""Blow-Up.""",1
"Despite the and dirty conditions, Guan is stoic. ""The bathroom situation is inconvenient,"" he admitted. But ""Chinese people are used to small spaces. My friends say my room is.He speaks to his parents several times a week but has provided few details about his squalid home. He tells them he's living comfortably and asks them not to send too much money.",1
"Guan found a couple of gigs, but nothing well-paid or satisfying. Still, he would not waver from his goal of a job in television. He had invested too much and it was too soon to give up. On he would show up at employers' offices unannounced. Some would talk to him. Others angrily asked how he got their address. He felt he had to try harder because he lacked the family or so central to aancement in Chinese society.",1
"With millions graduating from college each year and few jobs awaiting them, the country's central planners worry that a mass social experiment that created a class of professionals is backfiring.",1

Reporting from San Francisco -- The California Court appeared divided Wednesday over how to handle a $15.6-million jury won by a model who discovered his face on a jar of Taster's Choice coffee.,1
"The case is being closely watched by the entertainment and media industries. The Motion Picture Assn. of America and the Los Angeles Times have sided with Nestle USA Inc., the maker of Taster's Choice, while the Screen Actors and the American of Television and Radio Artists support the model, Russell Christoff.",1
Christoff said he posed for Nestle in 1986 for $250 and had a signed contract that he would receive more money if his picture was used in advertising. The contract also said that any other use of his photograph had to be negotiated.,1
"Standing in line at a Home Depot store in May 2002, Christoff, then a teacher, said a woman told him he looked like the guy on the coffee. Two months later, Christoff saw his on a coffee while shopping at a Aid drugstore.",1
Christoff unauthorized use of his image for commercial purposes. Nestle said it mistakenly believed that it had permission to use the photo and had been using it for years on Taster's Choice labels.,1
"An appeals court in Los Angeles threw out a 2005 against Nestle on the grounds that Christoff missed a legal deadline. The court said the case fell under the purview of invasion-of-privacy law, covered by a rule that says suits must be brought within two years of the publication at issue. Previous cases decided under that rule involved claims of defamation.",1
"In Wednesday's held in Los Angeles and monitored at the court's San Francisco headquarters, Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar said the rule was directed at single publications by newspapers and broadcasts but that the Nestle case involved ""a continuing course of conduct.""",1
"""That doesn't seem to fit a long marketing of a product with someone's misappropriated image,"" she said. She likened the use of Christoff's photograph to theft.Kelli L. Sager, Los Angeles Times said a ruling against Nestle could harm newspapers and threaten freedom of speech.""But this is a which in my mind puts it into a different light,"" Werdegar said.",1
"Justice Ming W. Chin, however, indicated that the rule for the news media should apply to product labels, while Chief Justice Ronald M. George suggested that the court did not have enough information to determine whether Nestle's use of the photograph constituted a single publication that would have invoked the two-year legal deadline. The trial court did not take evidence on that question.",1
Justice Joyce L. Kennard asked whether a case misappropriation of a person's likeness was more akin to an infringement of a than an. The lawyers for Nestle said no. Christoff's lawyer said yes.,1
"""This is not a case that has anything to do with free speech,"" said Colin C. Claxon, representing Christoff. ""This is a case about free advertising.""The court's decision in Christoff vs. Nestle USA is due within 90 days.",1

"Fastball, changeup or curve? Inside or outside, high or low? Slide step or full leg kick? There are hundreds, if not thousands, of a considers over the course of a nine game. Decisions, decisions.For UCLA¡¦s Gerrit Cole, one particular decision¡Xmade with consideration, due and enough to satisfy any thinker¡Xhas come to define who he is as a baseball player. Selected in the first round of the 2008 Major League draft, Cole was in a position to start his professional career with a seven-figure signing and fulfill his childhood dream of playing for the New York Yankees.But he said no.",1
"e was a away from playing for the most organization in all of sports. But he said no.Oh, to be 18 and talented enough to turn down more money than most people will make in a lifetime. But unlike most young Cole was not one of those kids who bounced between sports depending on the time of year. Yes, he dabbled a bit in soccer and football, but for the most part, he was a baseball player, focused on the diamond.",1
"Passion for the Yankees was a family affair, as dad Mark was a fan from New York. Father and son would catch their team on TV every chance they got. In 2001, the elder Cole scored a pair of tickets to see the Yanks play the Diamondbacks in the World Series in Phoenix. Heading into enemy territory, 11-year-old Gerrit felt right at home, donning his Yankee gear and carrying a sign pledging his allegiance to the visiting team. A heartbreaking loss in that series only his love for the team. And for the game.¡§I was sooo skinny,¡¨ recalls Cole, looking back on the formative days before he entered Orange Lutheran High School. But as he hit his mid teens, his appetite grew¡Xfor baseball and for food. ¡§I¡¦d come home from practice and eat the whole refrigerator.¡¨",1
"he means everything in the refrigerator, but with the way his body filled out to its current six-four, 215 pounds, who knows? With the extra weight came extra and lots of it. His fastball, which topped out in the mid-70 mph range as he entered high school, began to pick up. By the start of Cole¡¦s year, he was at more than 80 mph, and by the end of high school, his pitches reached the mid 90s. And that is the kind of speed that draws attention.In the world of Southern California baseball, where there are no secrets, word spread quickly. MLB scouts began appearing. So did agents. Scott Boras, who represents a majority of the sport¡¦s high players, showed up naturally and became an ¡§unpaid adviser.¡¨ The title allowed Cole to maintain his NCAA just in case.",1
"During a phenomenal senior season, in which he went 8¡V2 with a 0.47 ERA and 121 strikeouts in 752/3 Cole was regularly throwing a hot 98 miles per hour. Scouts, who were as blown away as the might have had their radar guns recalibrated to ensure their accuracy. ¡§You just don¡¦t see that type of arm unless you go to a major-league stadium,¡¨ says UCLA head coach John ¡§and even then, maybe only twice a week. A continent away, the big-market, big-money Yankees were well aware of Cole¡¦s talent, and last June, the team made him the 28th pick in the 2008 draft. That slot, considering the quality of the player and the wealth of the team that chose him, was worth millions. Florida high school and shortstop Casey Kelly¡Xchosen by the Boston Red Sox two picks later¡X got a signing bonus of $3 million. So, what the heck is Gerrit Cole doing at UCLA?",1
"Well, what at first might seem to be a pleasant from the old ¡§star athlete leaves school, early money grab¡¨ clich? might actually be something a bit less pure¡X and a bit less romantic.Yes, education is important to the Cole family, and college is a. But this was not just about that. It was about taking and and unemotionally watching the scales tip one way or another. Instead of a quick reach for mounds of money and a to the minors to learn the ways of baseball¡Xwhich would extend beyond honing his pitches to developing professional poise, understanding game and dealing with success and failure¡XCole made another choice. It was about far more than¡Xit was about life.",1
"¡§We did a ton of thinking¡Xjust an amount of thinking about this,¡¨ says Cole. ¡§My dad has a Ph.D., and he¡¦s a real visual kind of guy, so he made charts, and we went over financial figures, comparing people who are drafted in the first round and have somewhat of a baseball career with others who graduated college and the average of what they make in baseball and afterward. And money wasn¡¦t the only charted: The Coles evaluated whether three years in the minors would necessarily a shorter path to the majors than three years of college. And if an 18-year-old is truly ready for the real world of professional baseball.",1
"As they UCLA waited on pins and needles in its own private yes-or-no. As the college route seemed to become the clear choice, there was still one possibility at the Cole family. To truly consider all the factors, they had to account for the very real possibility of a career-ending injury. It was the availability of specialized insurance¡Xa little-known benefit sold through the NCAA and open to athletes who, in the governing body¡¦s words, can ¡§realistically receiving a amount of money as professional athletes¡¨¡Xthat tipped the scales.",1
"All the bases were covered. With a new policy in his back pocket and the old thunder still in his right arm, it was a done deal. Gerrit Cole was headed to UCLA.But what about that offer from the Yankees? ¡§There never was one,¡¨ says dad Mark, who was well aware of the reasonable range of the impending windfall. ¡§It was a decision based on what was the best route for Gerrit at the time.¡¨So no, ¡§Let¡¦s hear the number just for fun¡¨? Weren¡¦t the Coles even curious?",1
"¡§No. We didn¡¦t need to hear an offer,¡¨ insists the elder Cole. ¡§I made it very clear to the Yankees that if we went down that road and talked about money or other aspects of a contract, it would just be giving them the wrong impression.¡¨ The kid was going to school no matter what.On August 15¡Xdeadline day for a player to sign a contract¡Xthe Bruins coaching staff was gathered anxiously in the baseball office.When the phone rang, Coach looked up to see Cole¡¦s number on his caller ID. He hit the speaker button, hoping for the best but fearing the worst, as the room fell silent. The call didn¡¦t last all that long, but its reach will extend through the 2011 season. Three minutes on the phone became three years of firepower for the Bruins.",1
"¡§When I hung up, yeah, there was a good bit of a celebration,¡¨ says, smiling at the memory. ¡§Our staff knows this guy is a special talent, and we were going to have the oppor?tunity to get to groom him and his ability.¡¨ Cole¡¦s freshman year was an unquestionable success. He finished the regular season with an ERA of 3.49, a minuscule opponent batting average of .191 and 104 strikeouts in 85. He was named to the All Pac-10 team and was one of the first 17 players across the country invited to try out for the U.S. National Team¡Xwhich he made.",1
"Sure, a long-term plan is nice, but how many families would pass up buckets of right now for any reason? ¡§Four million is not four million,¡¨ insists Gerrit with the of a high-priced accountant. ¡§It¡¦s two million. You have to pay taxes, an agent¡Xit¡¦s not four mil. My dad and I broke it down to the nth degree.¡¨ Still, to a college kid, that¡¦s a lot of coin¡Xand he does occasionally think about the decision. ¡§I see the fancy cars in Beverly Hills, and I¡¦m like, Jeez, I could have one of those...¡¨For now, though, he¡¦ll have to settle for throwing gas, not burning it. And you get the feeling there¡¦s more than one fancy car in Gerrit Cole¡¦s future.",1

"Do you work well under pressure? In most cases, the best answer to this question is answering yes. Working well under pressure is a good to have. However, I think if you answer that you work the same with pressure and without pressure, the interviewer will be more impressed. However, you will need to explain in words why this is better. Here are some of my answers.",1
"""I work well under pressure because I use the pressure to help me work more efficiently.""""I enjoy working under pressure because I believe it helps me grow. In my previous experience, I always worked well during deadlines, and I always learned how to work more efficiently afterwards.""""I work well under pressure because I don't panic. I maintain self control and work as efficiently as possible. In all my experiences, I did well and I always enjoyed the experience.""""During times of pressure, I try to prioritize and plan as much as I can. After I'm organized, I really just put my head down and work hard in a smart way. I don't let the pressure affect me. So I believe I work well under pressure.""",1
"""To tell you the truth, I think I work the same if there's pressure or if there's no pressure. I try and take out negative emotional factors and work hard regardless of down time or busy time. I always prioritize and organize my work, and from there, work efficiently. If the situation involved pressure due to a lack of time, then the only difference in my work would be the extra time I would need to put in to meet the deadline on time. Since I believe my normal work is great work, then I suppose I work well under pressure."" I like this answer because it is different than the standard answer. If you are not comfortable with this answer, then you can use the next one. ""I have a couple of friends who hate working under pressure. I don't know if it's odd, but I really enjoy working under pressure. I use the feelings of pressure as a tool to motivate me to work harder and more efficiently. In my last job, I remember we had a project to complete in 4 days where it usually took 10 days. There was a lot of panic by some team members, but I ensured everyone that if we concentrate on the task and work real hard, we can complete the project. It took a lot of overtime, and the last day we were in the office until two AM, but we managed to finish. It was hard work, but I really enjoyed that experience.""

"One day at a mall in Ventura, Calif., a real named Jonell McLain had a epiphany. She had just sold a house and wanted to buy her a box of candy. Honestly that was all. That was the only reason she was out shopping.",1
"¡§Over the next three weeks Jonell was surprised how often she thought about the diamond necklace,¡¨ Cheryl Jarvis writes in ¡§The Necklace,¡¨ an inspirational-bling book that means to position itself somewhere between ¡§The Five People You Meet in Heaven¡¨ and ¡§The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.¡¨ Jonell McLain¡¦s innocence turned inspirational when she realized she could buy the necklace for entirely unselfish and uplifting reasons.",1
"And it was this selfless yet highly marketable ploy that led the story of the necklace to People magazine, ¡§Today,¡¨ a movie deal and no doubt, the best-seller lists. What accounts for this instant? Perhaps that everything about ¡§The Necklace¡¨ can be summed up in a single sentence. ¡§It¡¦s the story of 13 women who transformed a symbol of exclusivity into a symbol of inclusivity and, in the process, remapped the journey through the second half of their lives,¡¨ Ms. Jarvis writes.",1
"The inclusivity began at the haggling stage, when Ms. McLain and her friends returned to the jewelry store. Its proprietor, Tom Van Gundy, found these women surprising. Most of his female customers looked sad and needy. This bunch seemed happy and empowered. Mr. Van Gundy liked that. It made him want to accommodate them. ¡§It was the same feeling he had when he played quarterback in high school and didn¡¦t want to disappoint the fans,¡¨ according to the book.",1
"But the women couldn¡¦t quite match the purchase price. So Mr. Van Gundy had an idea. He looked at his wife, Priscilla, who did the store¡¦s bookkeeping. She didn¡¦t share the necklace-buyers¡¦ warm glow. She looked beleaguered. She didn¡¦t have female friends. Mr. Van Gundy realized that if he bought his wife a share in the necklace, he could make the sale, brighten lives, encourage sharing and make Priscilla smile again. The deal was done.",1
"Then came the ¡§possibility thinking,¡¨ the brainstorming, the rules. The women would have monthly meetings in their earth-tone living rooms, sharing mineral water, wine, goat cheese, artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes as they conducted business.",1
"During one such meeting they decided to give the necklace a cute name. Now it was a she: Jewelia, in honor of Julia Child, who had lived nearby. The women of Jewelia, as they began to speak of themselves, sorority-style, learned to share their hopes and dreams as well as the necklace. And when they talked together, one of them noticed: ¡§The women expressed differing opinions, but without raising their voices like the male pundits on Fox News. The women didn¡¦t call one another ¡¥wrong¡¦ or ¡¥stupid.¡¦ ¡¨",1
"It was initially decided that each would have Jewelia for a month. Making love at least once while wearing the diamonds was mandatory. So much for the: now came. Various Jewelia wearers went skydiving, karaoke singing, shooting, motorcycle riding. One of them insisted on wearing the necklace to a gynecological exam. The book includes photographic records of all of the above.",1
Among the aphorisms that crown Necklace chapters are these: ¡§Women friends are essential to a healthy life.¡¨ ¡§It that I don¡¦t need diamonds to be happy.¡¨ ¡§We are not what we wear or what we own. Today when I look in my closet I feel sick.,1
"One member of the group wears the diamonds to bed, feels sexually reinvigorated, decides to lose 25 pounds and starts ordering special costumes ¡X schoolgirl, cowgirl, harem girl, bar wench ¡X that drive her husband wild. But most of the others learn preachier lessons. And most of these lessons are useful. The group unquestionably helps others by using the necklace to raise money for charities and by appreciating the intangible, self-actualizing gifts that can¡¦t be had in jewelry stores.",1
"We aren¡¦t what we own or wear. But we are what we read. And ¡§The Necklace¡¨ will be read widely. Though Ms. Jarvis never says so, the best way to honor the book¡¦s principles is to share your copy with a friend.",1
"Using LEDs for general lighting may finally be a bright idea.In the past few years, light diodes have made huge advances in energy efficiency. Industry sources and outside experts say LEDs are now the most energy-efficient lighting source available. They use far less energy than other bulbs, last a lot longer, and cost less to use over their lifetime.",1
"For now, the lights still cost more than the average consumer is used to spending on a light bulb -- a lot more. Prices for LEDs on the market today can be more than five times what an incandescent bulb costs. However, the LEDs use about 85% less energy and last 30 times longer. They also use about half as much energy and last five times longer than fluorescent lights.",1
"Jim Brodrick, Solid State Lighting program manager for the U.S. Department of Energy, predicts that LEDs will save Americans $280 billion in energy costs over the next 20 years, and that the technology will make up 70% of the market by the end of that period.",1
"Some companies and a growing number of cities have started adding LEDs incrementally. For such users, the savings LEDs provide on energy bills, bulb and labor costs can often cover the higher up-front cost in about a year, industry experts say.Raleigh, N.C., recently installed LED lights in parking decks and other outdoor spaces. Dan Howe, assistant city manager, estimates that in one underground parking deck the change will save the city more than $700,000 in energy and costs over the 15-year lifetime of the LED products.",1
"""In four or five years, it will be a no-brainer,"" Mr. Howe says. ""Nobody is going to be doing anything without LEDs."" Residents have responded favorably as well, says Mr. Howe, who adds that the city plans to retrofit more city lighting with LEDs. ""We're about to spend $500,000 retrofitting perfectly good decks with perfectly good lighting in them because we're saying the paybacks are coming much faster,"" he says. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., after tests at two of its stores in Texas and Colorado, has decided to use LEDs in the freezers and refrigerators at all 4,200 of its stores in the U.S. A company spokesperson adds that tests are under way of LED lights in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store in Arkansas.",1
"For now, price remains the biggest obstacle, especially for use. But there are signs that this is changing as well. Consider ""down lights,"" the kind of directional, recessed lighting that is common in many homes and offices. LEDs are well-suited for this kind of lighting because they typically provide directional light (although some LED lamps have added lenses to give more light). But despite their suitability for this purpose, Sloan Ritchie, a sustainable-home builder in Seattle, says he isn't yet installing LED down lights because they're too expensive: about $80 each, compared with $15 for an incandescent and $35 for a fluorescent. Even though LEDs offer savings in the long run -- and use less energy -- consumers still are reluctant to pay more up front. However, with LED prices falling about 25% a year, Mr. Ritchie says he may begin using them next year.",1
"Some manufacturers already are test-marketing products in stores of Home Depot Inc., the big home-improvement. ""Within one to two years we will see much broader availability,"" says Michael Siminovitch, a University of California at Davis professor and head of the California Lighting Technology Center, a research organization based in Davis, Calif.",1
"The flexibility that LEDs give designers and architects to be more creative will change the way people look at lighting, Mr. Siminovitch says. ""They are very controllable,"" he says. ""You could start putting light in different places; maybe surfaces start glowing, or the walls light up, or the floors light up.""",1
"Several things still have to happen, meanwhile, for the LED market itself to light up. For one, as often happens with new technology, the quality of LED products currently on the market is uneven. Of 140 LED products in stores and tested by the U.S. Energy Department, more than half were considered poor quality. People get kind of interested, says the Energy Department's Mr. Brodrick, ""but buying it is something else.""To address quality concerns, the American National Standards Institute released the first LED standard early this year. More recently, the Engineering Society of North America, the standard-setting body for the lighting industry, created two more standards. The Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, also have released an LED Energy Star standard like the one for appliances.",1
Manufacturers can begin using the LED Energy Star label this month. Companies whose products fail to meet the can either try to improve their products or remove them from the market. Product test results are posted on an Energy Department Web site (www.netl.doe.gov/ssl/comm_testing.htm).,1
